Thus, on the four 80GB A100 nodes, the memory utilization varies between 23%-27% depending the maximum generated output length. This under-utilization of memory implies that it may be possible to co-locate multiple models on the same set of GPUs to increase aggregate throughput and potentially reduce cloud compute costs or improve system utilization at a supercomputer center. With new GPU sharing capabilities such as Multi-Process Service (MPS) [27] and Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) [28], a single GPU may be shared by diverse workloads for an overall improvement in system throughput as shown in recent work [29]. The optimal GPU configuration for sharing LLMs and other workloads is a part of our future work in this area. In this paper, we show the results of benchmarking a representative large language model on NVIDIA GPUs. We show baseline results from smaller models (7B, 13B) and compare them against the largest available version (65B) of LLaMA. For example, we find that, at a minimum, 8 V100 GPUs each with 32 GB of RAM or 4 A100 GPUs each with 80GB of memory are required for any meaningful inferences with the 65B LLaMA model. In each case among our experiments, we shard the model evenly across all GPUs in order to fit the model/data; however, this results in only 20%-25% of the GPU memory being utilized at any given time. This over-provisioning of resources represents new opportunities for resource sharing across multiple workloads in the latest NVIDIA GPUs.","The context explicitly states that 8 V100 GPUs each with 32 GB of RAM are required for any meaningful inferences with the 65B LLaMA model."
