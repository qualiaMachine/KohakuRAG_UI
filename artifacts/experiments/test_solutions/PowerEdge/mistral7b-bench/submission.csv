The most common scenario is for AI workloads to run on graphics processing units (GPUs), which provide significant acceleration compared to CPUs (central processing units) but are more power-hungry (often consuming 250W-350W, compared to CPU consumption of 10-150W). Due to specialization to the matrix multiply operations at the core of neural network computations and a high rate of parallelization, GPUs can perform many more of these types of computations in the same amount of time as a CPU, but this increased computation throughput comes at an increased energy cost. Thus in ML applications based on deep learning, the majority of the electricity consumption is due to the GPU [ 5, 45].

"q315","For a sparse Mixtral model fine-tuned with a NVIDIA A40-48 GB, what was the batch size (in samples) of the longest-running MoE layer?","The maximum batch size for the longest-running MoE layer in the fine-tuned Mixtral model on the NVIDIA A40-48 GB GPU is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, Table III shows the maximum batch size supported by different models and datasets for both dense and sparse fine-tuning. For Mixtral on the CS dataset, the maximum batch size supported is 8 for sparse fine-tuning. Since the question asks for the longest-running MoE layer, we can infer that the batch size for the longest-running MoE layer is also 8.","8","samples","[""xia2024""]","is_blank","Table III","The maximum batch size for the longest-running MoE layer in the fine-tuned Mixtral model on the NVIDIA A40-48 GB GPU is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

"q317","What is the total execution time, in seconds, of a sparse Mixtral model fine-tuned with a NVIDIA A40-48GB with a batch size of 10?","The context does not provide specific information about the execution time, in seconds, of a sparse Mixtral model fine-tuned with a NVIDIA A40-48GB with a batch size of 10. However, it does mention that the cost of fine-tuning a sparse Mixtral model on a different GPU (NVIDIA H100) is $3460. Since the cost is proportional to the time taken for fine-tuning, we can estimate the time taken on the A40-48GB GPU by dividing the cost of the H100 GPU by the cost of the A40-48GB GPU and multiplying by the time taken on the H100 GPU. The cost of the H100 GPU is not provided in the context, but it can be found in Table IV. The cost of the A40-48GB GPU can be calculated by dividing the cost of the H100 GPU by the ratio of their memory capacities, as mentioned in the context.","is_blank","seconds","[""xia2024""]","is_blank","Table IV estimates the cost for fine-tuning Mixtral on the MATH dataset with a sparse setup, using 10 epochs on different GPUs for a realistic cost estimate.","The context does not provide specific information about the execution time, in seconds, of a sparse Mixtral model fine-tuned with a NVIDIA A40-48GB with a batch size of 10.
