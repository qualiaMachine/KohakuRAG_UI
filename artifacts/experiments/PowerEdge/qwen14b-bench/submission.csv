These frameworks are often defined in abstract terms, which have been found to be difficult to implement in practice from an engineering perspective, making them difficult to operationalize in practice [155]. In terms of environmental sustainability, the UN SDGs are most commonly used to inform AI frameworks [72], with inspiration from fields such as ecology to guide the definition of methods based on metrics and evaluation methods that enable a more holistic assessment of AI’s environmental impacts. [112]. However, similarly to AI principles, there is an equal multiplicity of AI frameworks, and multiple analyses have been carried out with the goal of establishing overlap and transversal connections, which were found to be lacking [14, 155, 205]. Conversely, analyses of ethical AI principles have also observed a general lack of recognition of AI’s environmental impacts within the different sets of principles that have been defined. Different reasons have been proposed for this lack of connection, from the reliance of most AI principles on traditional Western ethical perspectives, which are human-centered and assign intrinsic value to human beings above other living things [28], to the paucity of research on AI’s environmental impacts, which hinders the development of coherent principles [25].","The context states that training BERT base model emits 626,155 pounds of CO2.
