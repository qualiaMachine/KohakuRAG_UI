As this world is simul-\ntaneously grappling with climate change, the climate effects and\nenvironmental implications of the development and use of AI have\nbecome an important subject of public and academic debate.

In\nparticular, we propose a specific interpretation of the AI Act to bring\nreporting on the previously unaddressed energy consumption from\nAI inferences back into the scope. We also find that the AI Act fails\nto address indirect greenhouse gas emissions from AI applications.\nFurthermore, for the purpose of energy consumption reporting, we\ncompare levels of measurement within data centers and recommend\nmeasurement at the cumulative server level. We also argue for an\ninterpretation of the AI Act that includes environmental concerns\nin the mandatory risk assessments (sustainability risk assessment,\nSIA), and provide guidance on its operationalization. The EU data\ncenter regulation proves to be a good first step but requires further\ndevelopment by including binding renewable energy and efficiency\ntargets for data centers. Overall, we make twelve concrete policy\nproposals, in four main areas: Energy and Environmental Reporting\nObligations; Legal and Regulatory Clarifications; Transparency and\nAccountability Mechanisms; and Future Far-Reaching Measures\nbeyond Transparency.\nACM Reference Format:\nKai Ebert, Nicolas Alder, Ralf Herbrich, and Philipp Hacker. 2025.

This inherently intertwines\nthe digital transformation with questions of climate change, partic-\nularly concerning the energy and water consumption of AI models.\nThese features are attracting attention from both the public and\nacademia (see below, 2.). Concerns are growing that the supply\nof renewable energy may not keep up with their increasing de-\nmand triggered by the AI scaling race [4] in which the EU is poised\nto join the U.S. and China under the EU Commission’s new AI\nContinent Action Plan [25]. Scholars and activists, in turn, are in-\ncreasingly critiquing and situating digital technology within the\nframework of environmental justice [28, 40, 67, 72, 81]. Work in po-\nlitical economy has shed a light on the extractive nature of AI-based\nsocio-technical systems, extracting and, at times, exploiting, both\nnatural and human resources [18, 24, 39, 42, 58], often particularly\nfrom marginalized communities [61, 65] and regions [50, 80]. Both\nthe quest for performance and the funding logic behind AI force\nproviders to scale them to a point where this trajectory may push\nagainst planetary limits [8–10, 18].\nRegulatory frameworks are beginning to address these chal-\nlenges, too. While the new U.S. administration scraps environmen-\ntal rules and generally deregulates, the EU Artificial Intelligence\nAct (AI Act) becomes applicable as the world’s most comprehensive\nattempt at direct AI regulation. It features environmental protection\nas one of its core goals and contains dedicated sustainability rules,\nwhich also apply to US and other non-EU providers offering models\nin the EU. Similarly, the Digital Services Act (DSA) compels Very\nLarge Online Platforms and Very Large Online Search Engines to\nthoroughly assess and mitigate systemic risks, which is of particu-\nlar relevance for hybrid platforms increasingly integrating AI. As\nscholars have pointed out, this includes climate and sustainabil-\nity risks [11], and intersects partially with obligations under the\nAI Act [32, 36]. In parallel, the Energy Efficiency Directive (EU)\n2023/1791 introduces transparency obligations for data centers, a\ncritical infrastructure supporting AI. However, these regulatory in-\nstruments were developed independently, leading to fragmentation\nand gaps. The AI Act originally pursued climate-related objectives\nespecially in the European Parliament’s position of June 2023, but\nover successive drafts and the trilogue negotiations, its environ-\nmental provisions were diluted, particularly with regard to energy\nconsumption from AI inference and risk assessments. Meanwhile,\narXiv:2410.06681v2  [cs.CY]  25 May 2025\n\nConference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Kai Ebert, Nicolas Alder, Ralf Herbrich, and Philipp Hacker\nthe EU’s data center regulation remains incomplete, lacking bind-\ning efficiency and renewable energy targets. These shortcomings\nthreaten to undermine the most promising legislative avenues for\ntackling AI’s climate effects. The EU’s recent push for massive\ninvestments in computing infrastructure under the AI Continent\nAction Plan, including the establishment of AI Gigafactories [25],\nis a late but necessary impetus for technological and strategic au-\ntonomy but must not endanger the Union’s climate goals under the\nGreen New Deal.\nAgainst this background, this paper makes three key contribu-\ntions. First, we offer the first thorough analysis of the AI Act’s final\nversion from an environmental perspective. Unlike prior scholar-\nship, which has examined these areas separately, we also scrutinize\nthe interplay between data center regulation and direct AI regula-\ntion. AI sustainability is not governed by a single legal instrument\nbut rather emerges from the interaction of multiple frameworks\nand actors. This fragmented approach creates legal uncertainty\nand regulatory loopholes — notably the omission of AI inference\nfrom reporting obligations and the failure to mandate Sustainability\nImpact Assessments (SIA). We then propose a novel interpretation\nof the AI Act to include AI inferences in the reporting obligations\nof general-purpose AI providers, and to incorporate sustainability\nconsiderations into the mandatory risk assessment framework to\neffectuate the goal of environmental protection enshrined in Art. 1\nand Recitals 1, 2 and 8.\nSecond, we examine the practical challenges of implementing\nAI-related environmental obligations and provide technical recom-\nmendations. The crux here is to operationalize existing rules and\nmake climate reporting work by developing metrics that are both\nmeaningful and workable in practice.\nThird, we identify areas where the AI Act and related regulatory\nframeworks require future amendments. In light of upcoming eval-\nuation rounds, we advocate for closing loopholes and reinstating\nenvironmental obligations that were weakened during the legisla-\ntive process. While the current political momentum seems to favor\nderegulation, the climate emergency persists. Therefore, it is cru-\ncial to improve the best legal tools still available, and to advocate\nfor a nuanced legal framework to bring the twin transitions of AI\nand climate together. Our twelve policy proposals address four key\nareas: Energy and Environmental Reporting Obligations; Legal and\nRegulatory Clarifications; Transparency and Accountability Mech-\nanisms; and Future Far-Reaching Measures beyond Transparency.\n2 Related Work\nDue to the interdisciplinary nature of sustainable AI, related works\noriginate from three main fields—computer science; humanities and\npolicy; and legal research. In recent years, the computer science and\nAI community has become increasingly aware of the environmental\neffects of AI, which led to both policy-oriented [ 8, 14, 29, 37, 44,\n45, 52, 54, 56, 70, 76] and technical contributions, particularly on\nthe environmental effects of data centers operations and AI-related\ncomputing [2, 30, 62], studies for tracking [1, 19, 23, 51, 53, 55, 64, 79,\n82] and techniques for reducing the emissions of data centers and AI\nmodels [7, 31, 43, 46, 57]. The water consumption of AI training has\nalso been a concern [49, 83]. Broader scholarship and policy work\nincludes ethical [15, 27], informational [20, 54, 63, 75], and social\nperspectives [6]. Numerous contributions also analyze and evaluate\nthe various means in which AI may be used to mitigate, and adapt to,\nclimate change [13, 17, 34, 41, 47, 68, 69, 75], as also acknowledged in\nthe AI Act (Recitals 4 and 142). However, from a legal perspective,\nthe problem of sustainable AI remains underexplored. Existing\ncontributions date from before the AI Act’s final version [63], which\ndiffers significantly from previous proposals (see below, 5.2.) or do\nnot engage with its provisions in detail [33]. Other, complimentary\nwork focuses uniquely on the DSA [11] or data center regulation\n[16].\n3 Technical Background\nFrom a technical perspective, it is important to distinguish between\n(pre-)training, fine-tuning, and inference. Training refers to the\nprocess of initially adjusting a model’s parameters or weights to\nfit the data. This process is highly compute-intensive and typically\nrequires a significant amount of energy [37, 53, 55, 79]. LLM perfor-\nmance strongly depends on the model scale (number of parameters),\nwhich in turn requires more training data [38, 66], and hence more\nresources. Such scaling can even be expected with algorithmically\nadvanced models, such as DeepSeek R1 [3].\nFine-tuning aims at adjusting a pretrained model to fit more\nspecific data in order to perform better at specific tasks. It involves\na significantly smaller amount of training data and compute budget.\nThe specific procedure for successful fine-tuning is very model-,\ndata-, and task-specific, and rather empirical. Therefore, the com-\nputational and energy-intensity can vary significantly for this step.\nFor example, as highlighted by Luccioni et al. [55], the energy usage\nfor fine-tuning the Bloomz-7B required 7,571 kWh compared to\n51,686 kWh for the entire training process, adding another 15 % to\nthe initial consumption. Inference, in turn, refers to the procedure\nof generating a prediction from a trained model. Typically, an indi-\nvidual inference consumes little energy compared to training; but\nthere are many more inference than training events.\nMost of these training, fine-tuning and inference computations\nare conducted in data centers. The power usage effectiveness (PUE)\nmetric reflects the energy efficiency of a data center. It indicates\nthe ratio of the total energy needed by a data center, including\ncomponents such as cooling, to the energy used solely by computa-\ntional devices. A PUE of 1.0 would imply ideal efficiency, meaning\nthat the data center uses only the energy necessary to power the\ncomputational devices. The average data center PUE in 2023 was\n1.58 globally[74] and 1.6 in the EU [26].\n4 Regulation of Data Centers\nData centers run all kinds of operations, such as cloud computing,\ncrypto currencies and the Internet at large. Recently, AI training\nand inference have experienced massive growth. Broad data center\nregulation, therefore, indirectly governs the environmental effects\nof AI and constitutes the backdrop against which specific AI regu-\nlation must be viewed. Taking a look at the requirements for data\ncenters can help to find a coherent and effective interpretation of\nthe requirements in the AI Act as it builds on already available data\nand established methodology.\n\nAI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data Centers to the AI Act Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\n4.1 EU Data Collection and Reporting\nObligations for Data Centers\nIn the EU, data collection and reporting obligations for data centers\nwere established by two recent legal acts, Art. 12 of the recast\nEnergy Efficiency Directive EU/2023/1791 of September 13, 2023\n(\"EED\"), and the Commission Delegated Regulation EU/2024/1364\nof March 14, 2024 (\"Delegated Regulation\"). The new rules apply\nto all data centers in the EU with a power demand of the installed\ninformation technology (IT) of at least 500kW, which includes small-\nsized data centers. Data center operators are required to collect,\nmake publicly available and report to a EU database information\nthat is deemed relevant for the sustainability assessment of the data\ncenters and the industry as a whole. The reporting is mandated on\nan annual basis.\nThe required data includes energy consumption, power utiliza-\ntion, temperature set points, waste heat utilisation, water usage\nand use of renewable energy (EED, Annex VII(c)). Notably, while\nthe EED focuses on energy and power, the reporting of water usage\nis a significant step forward as both energy and water consumption\nhave raised concerns in AI settings [49, 55]. In addition, the Water\nFramework Directive can be harnessed to limit the overall amount\nwater a data center may consume, and also control for any potential\nloss of water quality [33].\nThe Delegated Regulation provides specific key performance\nindicators and methodology. Most notable is the requirement to\nmeasure and report the energy consumption of the installed infor-\nmation technology. Following the standard-methodology for the\ncalculation of PUE,1 the energy consumption must be measured at\nthe uninterruptible power system (UPS) or, if not existent, at the\npower distribution unit (PDU) or at another point specified by the\ndata center (see Delegated Regulation, Annex II(1)(e); see also the\nappendix, Figure 1 as Categories 1-3.\nThe data centers must report to the EU database directly or\nvia a national reporting scheme, if such a scheme is implemented\nby the Member State. From the reported data the Commission\ncalculates the data center sustainability indicators which are made\npublicly available on an aggregate level. They include the power\nusage effectiveness (PUE), the water usage effectiveness (WUE)2,\nthe energy reuse factor (ERF) 3, and the renewable energy factor\n(REF)4.\n4.2 Energy Management Systems and Energy\nAudits\nThe EED also requires that Member States mandate companies\nwith an average annual energy consumption of more than 10 TJ to\nconduct an energy audit at least every four years and those with a\nconsumption of more than 85 TJ to implement an energy manage-\nment system including regular energy audits (Art. 11 EED). This\nwould also apply to operators of data centers. The Directive sets\n1The Delegated Regulation refers to the European standard CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-\n4-2.\n2WUE measures the amount of water used in the data center’s cooling and other\noperations relative to the energy consumed by the IT stack.\n3ERF represents the percentage of energy that is reused from a data center’s waste\nenergy, showing the efficiency of energy recovery.\n4REF indicates the proportion of a data center’s energy that comes from renewable\nsources.\nup certain minimum criteria for energy audits (Annex VI EED) and\nrefers to the relevant international or European standards (Recital\n80 EED). The legal minimum criteria, however, do not dictate how\nenergy consumption should be measured.\n4.3 German 2023 Energy Efficiency Act\nIn Germany, the Energy Efficiency Act of 8 Nov 2023 implements\nthe EED and establishes a national reporting scheme and additional\nrequirements, including specific efficiency and renewable energy\ntargets for data centers. The Act broadens the scope of the report-\ning obligation to include even smaller data centers, upwards of 300\nkW (Sec. 13). It also expands the duty to set up an energy manage-\nment system to data centers and operators of ICT—i.e., customers\nof colocation data centers—of more than 50 kW (Sec. 12). Most im-\nportantly, it sets targets on energy efficiency and renewable energy\nuse, requiring data centers to reach a PUE factor between 1.5 and\n1.2 and an ERF of 10% to 20 % depending on their age (Sec. 11), and\nto run on 50 % renewable energy, increasing that factor to 100% by 1\nJan 2027 (Sec. 11). Lastly, it requires data center operators to inform\ntheir customers on an annual basis on the energy consumption\ndirectly attributable to them (Sec. 15).\n4.4 Regulation Outside the EU\nOutside the EU, a number of countries is taking the lead by im-\nplementing concrete PUE goals, such as Singapore, Japan, China,\nand Australia, while the U.S. as one of the main contributors in\nthe AI race shows a nuanced picture. However, it should be noted\nthat some of these measures are limited to procurement policies or\nmere political commitments where it is unclear if there will be any\npenalty-enabled enforcement like in the German Energy Efficiency\nAct. A direct comparison of PUE target values should, therefore, be\nmade with this caveat in mind.\nUnder the 2024 Green Data Center Roadmap, Singapore aims\nto reach a PUE of 1.3 or less within 10 years [ 71]. Japan, with its\n2022 Energy Conservation Act, requires data center operators to\ntake efficiency measures to reach a target PUE of 1.4 by 2030 [12].\nMeanwhile, in China, according to Li et al., policies issued from\n2013 onward introduced efficiency targets, gradually decreasing\nthe required PUE from 1.5 in 2013 to 1.3 in 2021 [48]. However, the\nauthors also admit that most recent data still shows a significant\nimplementation gap with the actual PUE of most data centers rang-\ning between 1.4 and 2.0. As part of Australia’s 2023 Net Zero in\nGovernment Operations Strategy, data center services procured by\nthe government must demonstrate a five-star energy rating under\nthe national NABERS scheme, including a PUE of 1.4 or lower. This\nrequirement applies to procurement from members of the distin-\nguished Data Centre Panel, and from 1 July 2025, it will extend to\nother companies and state-operated data centers [21].\nIn the U.S., in the absence of federal efficiency requirements, the\nonly direct regulation for data center efficiency is the California\nGreen Building Action Plan 2015 implementing Executive Order B-\n18-12. Data centers that exceed a PUE of 1.5 are required to reduce\ntheir PUE by a minimum of 10 percent per year until they achieve\na 1.5 or lower PUE. However, similar to the Australian action, this\nplan is only limited to state data centers [22, 73].\n\nConference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Kai Ebert, Nicolas Alder, Ralf Herbrich, and Philipp Hacker\nAnother noteworthy strain of regulation is the climate reporting\nset forth in the SEC climate disclosure rules, and, on a state level, the\nCalifornia Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, also known\nas SB 253. While the California Act goes further in including private\ncompanies and scope 3 indirect emissions, it is limited to companies\nwith USD 1 B in annual revenue. For the SEC rules as well as SB\n253 the focus is on the companies’ total emissions, therefore direct\nattribution to AI or computing energy consumption will be difficult.\nRelating to AI more specifically, although not limited to data\ncenters, is a bill for an AI Environmental Impacts Act that was\nintroduced in the U.S. Senate by Senator Edward J. Markey (D-\nMA) on 1 Feb 2024 [ 78]. The bill was referred to the Committee\non Commerce, Science and Transportation, and has not yet been\nvoted upon. Under the new administration, it is unlikely that the\nbill will pass Congress. However, even if enacted, it would not\ncontain any significant hard regulation. The bill primarily mandates\nstudies, stakeholder consultations, and voluntary reporting on AI’s\nenvironmental impacts without imposing significant regulatory\nobligations.\n4.5 Discussion and Interim Conclusion on Data\nCenter Regulation\nThe regulation of data centers in the context of AI’s environmen-\ntal impact, particularly regarding energy and water consumption,\npresents both advantages and shortcomings. The increasing growth\nof AI-related activities, such as training and inference, places sig-\nnificant pressure on the environmental footprint of data centers.\nWhile the EU has implemented generic data center regulations,\nsuch as those outlined in the Energy Efficiency Directive and the\nDelegated Regulation, these rules also indirectly govern the envi-\nronmental impact of AI by imposing reporting and data collection\nrequirements. Notably, these regulations require the reporting of\nboth energy and water consumption, a critical aspect given the\nrising concerns over resource use in AI applications.\nOne of the key strengths of the EU’s approach is the establish-\nment of specific reporting obligations. Data center operators must\ncollect and publicly report energy consumption, power utilization,\nwater usage, waste heat utilization, and the use of renewable energy.\nThese measures help create transparency and provide a foundation\nfor future efficiency improvements. Additionally, the German im-\nplementation of the EED goes beyond mere reporting by setting\nspecific targets for energy efficiency and renewable energy use\nin data centers, as well as requiring smaller data centers to com-\nply. Germany’s approach might serve as a potential blueprint for\nbroader EU regulation, particularly mandating data center opera-\ntors to inform customers about their direct energy consumption,\nan essential factor for optimizing AI-related energy use.\nHowever, the regulations also present several shortcomings.\nWhile data collection and reporting obligations are useful, the ab-\nsence of binding efficiency and renewable energy targets at the EU\nlevel is a major limitation. Although the Commission is expected\nto propose further legislative measures by 2025, the current lack of\nenforceable standards means that data centers could continue to\nconsume vast amounts of energy and water without significant re-\nductions in their environmental impact. Moreover, while Germany\nhas introduced stricter targets, these do not extend to all Member\nStates, potentially leading to a fragmented regulatory environment\nacross the EU.\nIn contrast, the situation outside the EU shows a very diverse\nlandscape, ranging from government procurement to industry wide\npolitical commitments and concrete legal requirements with vary-\ning implementation success.\n5 AI Act: Gaps and Interpretation Challenges\nThe AI Act applies further down in the value chain, targeting enti-\nties that develop and deploy AI systems. After introducing the key\nterminology used by the Act, we discuss the major climate-related\nobligations contained in it, with a particular focus on transparency,\nrisk assessment and mitigation. As our analysis shows, the Act\nmakes steps in the right direction, but falls short of a comprehen-\nsive regime for tackling climate-related risks of AI models.\n5.1 Terminology of the AI Act: AI, Providers,\nand Deployers\nThe AI Act only applies if an AI model or AI system is used by a\nspecifically designated entity, such as a provider or deployer. The\nactivity also needs to relate to the EU, typically either because\nthe system is offered to persons in the EU or because its output\nis used in the EU (Art. 2(1) and Recital 22 AI Act). An AI system\nis defined as a machine-based system ’designed to operate with\nvarying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after\ndeployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from\nthe input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions,\ncontent, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical\nor virtual environments’ (Art. 3(1)).\nKey actors in the AI value chain include providers and deployers.\nProviders develop or market AI models or systems (Art. 3(3)) while\ndeployers use existing AI systems in a professional capacity (Art.\n3(4)). Note that other operationally relevant actors, such as cloud\nservice providers, data providers, data center operators, or other\nintermediaries, are not directly subject to AI Act rules.\nThe Act pays specific attention to general-purpose AI (GPAI)\nmodels, e.g., large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, that are\ndefined by the wide range of possible uses. Those with the most\nadvanced capabilities, and therefore higher risk of negative effects,\nare labeled GPAI models with systemic risk (Art. 3(63)-(65)). An AI\nsystem that integrates a GPAI model is a general-purpose AI system\n(Art. 3(66)), e.g., ChatGPT. AI systems used in specific settings\nsubject to product safety regulation, e.g., medical devices, and areas\nparticularly sensitive for public safety or fundamental rights, e.g.,\nlaw enforcement, education, employment, or credit scoring, are\ncalled high-risk AI (HRAI) systems. These systems are subject to\nother rules, concerning training data, documentation, human in the\nloop, and performance, inter alia (Art. 9-16). When GPAI systems\nare used in high-risk applications, rules may apply cumulatively\n(Recital 85, 97).\nThe AI Act contains energy- and climate-related transparency\nand risk management obligations, primarily for providers of AI\nsystems or models. Under certain conditions (e.g., fine-tuning),\nhowever, deployers become providers, which triggers much more\nonerous duties, also with respect to climate impacts (Art. 25(1),\n\nAI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data Centers to the AI Act Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\nRecital 109). Hence, there is a palpable incentive for companies to\navoid provider status.\nConcerning HRAI systems, pursuant to Art. 25(1), deployers can\nbecome providers if they market an existing HRAI system under\ntheir name or trademark, substantially modify an HRAI system, or\nchange the intended purpose of a non-high-risk AI system such\nthat it falls under one of the high-risk sectors (e.g., employment;\nlife- or health insurance; education). Specifically, if a deployer uses\na GPAI system, such as ChatGPT, in a high-risk setting, for example,\nby harnessing it for resume screening in hiring, they automatically\nassume the responsibilities of a provider of an HRAI system (Art.\n25(1)(c)).\nAn existing HRAI system can be altered. If the modification is\nsubstantial, the modifying entity becomes a new provider (Article\n25(1)(b)). It is unclear, however, what precisely constitutes a \"sub-\nstantial modification\" that would trigger provider status for the\nmodifying entity. A formal interpretation suggests that any change\nto the model could be deemed substantial, based on Art. 3(23), which\ndefines substantial modification as any unplanned change affect-\ning compliance or intended purpose. On the other hand, a—more\nconvincing—material interpretation would claim that provider sta-\ntus should only apply if the modification increases the model’s\nrisk in a nonnegligible way. This aligns with the AI Act’s focus on\nrisk mitigation and also the language in Article 3(23) according to\nwhich any significant modification must affect compliance with the\nhigh-risk rules of the Act (or change the purpose).\nFor GPAI models, Recitals 97, 109, and 111 suggest that any\nentity performing even minimal fine-tuning of a GPAI model is\nautomatically classified as the provider of a new model, including\nall associated responsibilities [4]. For minor modifications this is\ndisproportionate, even if Recital 109 states that obligations are\nlimited to the fine-tuning itself [4]. A solution could be an analogy\nwith Article 25(1)(b) so that provider status would only be triggered\nby a substantial modification made through fine-tuning, rather than\nany minor changes [4].\nThis is particularly important for SMEs using powerful mod-\nels (GPAI models with systemic risk): if they become providers,\nthey need to comply with the much more stringent obligations in\nArticle 55 concerning evaluation and risk management, including\nenvironmental risk.\n5.2 Legislative History and Intent\nIn the original Commission proposal of April 2021, the AI Act only\nincluded minimal references to environmental effects, mostly as a\npotential benefit to climate change mitigation (see above, 2.), and\nin the section on voluntary commitments [ 63]. The General Ap-\nproach adopted by the Council in December 2022 continued this\nnarrow framing. However, the momentum changed, particularly\nwith the position of the European Parliament (EP), published in\nJune 2023. The suggested EP sustainability amendments to the AI\nAct introduce environmental principles for AI development, prefer-\nential funding for eco-friendly AI, mandatory energy and resource\nconsumption reporting, sustainability risk assessments (SIAs) for\nfoundation models, and Commission-led guidance on environmen-\ntal impact measurement and review [33]. During the final trilogue\nnegotiations, several of these amendments were dropped (e.g., the\nprinciple; explicit SIAs). However, simultaneously, the impact of\nfundamental rights was strengthened, and environmental protec-\ntion listed as one such right that must be considered in a range of\nprovisions [33, 63]. This is supported by the mention of environ-\nmental protection as a key policy goal of the AI Act in Article 1\nand Recitals 1, 2 and 8.\n5.3 Transparency\nThe first climate-related obligation in the AI Act concerns trans-\nparency and reporting, however not with respect to data centers,\nbut concerning providers of high-risk and GPAI models [ 4]. Yet,\nthe rules come with significant ambiguities and loopholes. In the\nfollowing, we detail the six most important ones.\n1) For high-risk AI systems, pursuant to Article 11(1) providers\nmust document the computational resources utilized during the\ndevelopment, training, testing, and validation stages, as outlined in\nAnnex IV(2) which does, however, not include the energy consump-\ntion directly [4]. This omission hinders the capacity to evaluate and\ncompare the environmental impact of such systems accurately. As\na result, the environmental footprint must be estimated indirectly\nbased on the recorded computational resources.\n2) The AI Act requires providers of general-purpose AI models\nto meet transparency obligations. Article 53(1)(a) mandates that\nproviders maintain up-to-date technical documentation, including\nthe details outlined in Annex XI. This annex requires the reporting\nof energy consumption, whether known or estimated, while esti-\nmates may be based on the computational resources used. However,\nthis requirement exhibits a significant gap as it only covers the\nenergy used during the model’s development phase, but leaves out\nthe inference phase [4]. Recent research has shown that energy con-\nsumption during inference often exceeds that of the development\nphase very significantly over time [55, 79].\nTo bridge this gap, we propose an alternative interpretation,\nbased on the information provided to downstream actors (see also\n[4]). As a result of the AI Act, providers must supply downstream\ndevelopers and relevant authorities with technical information on\nhow to incorporate GPAI models into AI systems (Articles 53(1)(a)\nand (b), together with Annex XI and Annex XII). While energy\nconsumption is not explicitly referenced in these provisions, they\ncould reasonably be understood to include details about the com-\nputational resources required for inference because downstream\nproviders need this information to properly allocate resources, e.g.,\npurchasing computing power for operating the model. As a side-\neffect, this information could be used to calculate energy consump-\ntion for individual inferences. However, to calculate the overall\nenergy consumption for inferences, the total number of inferences\nwould need to be available as well. While the typical energy costs of\ninferences should therefore be mandatorily disclosed by providers,\ndeployers should be compelled to divulge information on the num-\nber of inferences, as well, e.g., on an aggregate monthly level.\n3) Open-source (OS) GPAI models are largely excluded from\ntransparency requirements unless they present a systemic risk,\nas outlined in Articles 2(12) and 53(2) [ 4]. The idea is that OS\nmodels, by definition, already disclose certain types of informa-\ntion. Hence, Recital 102 lists information on parameters, including\nweights, model architecture, and model usage as a prerequisite for\n\nConference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Kai Ebert, Nicolas Alder, Ralf Herbrich, and Philipp Hacker\nsystems to be considered OS. However, it does not mandate the\ndisclosure of energy consumption. This results in an unwarrented\nlack of visibility concerning the environmental impact and energy\nusage of these models.\n4) Where the Act does mandate the disclosure of energy con-\nsumption, this information is restricted to authorities and is not\naccessible to downstream providers (unless the proposed interpreta-\ntion from 2) is applied) or the general public, due to confidentiality\nclauses in Articles 21(3), 53(7), and 78(1) [4]. The limited availability\nof this data significantly reduces transparency and accountability,\ntheryby weakening the potential for public oversight and market\nresponses.\n5) The AI Act fails to address the greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-\nsions generated by AI applications, for instance in sectors like\noil and gas exploration [ 4, 37]. For example, a recent investiga-\ntion has revealed Microsoft’s aggressive pitch of its AI models to\nExxonMobile to optimize fossil fuel exploration [35]. Leaving such\napplications with significant climate effects out of scope creates a\nnotable reporting gap.\n6) The Act also neglects to address the substantial water con-\nsumption, a key concern in data center operations [4]. While the\nEnergy Efficiency Directive mandates reporting of water consump-\ntion for data centers, the AI Act requires no such reporting specifi-\ncally for AI—as it does for energy use—nor does it cover operations\noutside the EU.\n5.4 Environmental Risk Assessment and\nMitigation\nIn tackling the climate effects of AI and ICT more generally, it is\narguably crucial to move beyond mere transparency provisions\ntowards more substantive goals and obligations. Indeed, the AI Act\ndoes contain some language to this effect. For providers of GPAI\nmodels with systemic risk and providers of HRAI systems, the Act\nmandates risk assessment and mitigation (Art. 55(1)(b) and Art. 9).\nWe argue that these measures should also consider environmental\nrisks, in keeping with the normative goals of the AI Act listed in\nArticle 1 and Recitals 1, 2 and 8.\nCrucially, both provisions relate to risks of the AI model or sys-\ntem for fundamental rights which, within the AI Act, must be inter-\npreted as including environmental risks [5]. In Art. 1(1) and Recital\n1, the purpose of the AI Act is defined as protecting health, safety,\nfundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy,\nthe rule of law and environmental protection. However, in the doc-\ntrine of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\n(the Charter), environmental protection (Art. 37 of the Charta) is\nmerely an objective rule, not a fundamental right [60]. Democracy\nand the rule of law are not enshrined in a particular Article of the\nCharter but serve as guiding principles that permeate the Charter\nand all of the fundamental rights. Accordingly, they (only) find a\nmention in the preamble of the Charter.\nIn our view, the European legislator did not err on the doctri-\nnal classification of democracy, the rule of law and environmental\nprotection in the Charter by including these principles. While it is\nconceivable that a legislative error may have occurred in miscate-\ngorising the objective rule in Art. 37 of the Charta, that seems very\nunlikely for the basic principles merely expressed in the preamble.\nInstead, the more convincing interpretation is that, for the purposes\nof the AI Act, the legislator meant for these principles to be included\nwhenever the Act refers to fundamental rights. It is, besides, not\nuncommon for a legal term to have different meanings in different\nlegal settings.\nThus, it should not be dispositive that the explicit SIA contained\nin the EP position (see 5.2) was not included in the final version.\nRather, the provisions on risk assessment and mitigation form a cen-\nterpiece of the protective measures included in the AI Act. Without\nincluding environmental risks in the risk assessment and mitigation,\nin effect, not much consideration for environmental risks would\nremain and certainly not the \"high level of protection\" that Art. 1(1)\nmandates.\nAs a caveat, it should be noted that, while the AI Act requires\nclimate risk assessment and mitigation, no detailed reporting is\nmandated. For HRAI systems the documentation must comprise\na detailed description of the risk management system, but not the\nrisk assessment or its results (Annex IV(5)). Providers of GPAI mod-\nels with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice or European\nharmonized standards, both of which are not yet available, or alter-\nnative means of compliance for assessment by the Commission (Art.\n55(2)). If these will entail a detailed reporting of the risk assessment,\nand to whom, is yet to be determined.\n5.5 Discussion and Interim Conclusion on the\nAI Act\nOverall, while the AI Act introduces valuable steps toward address-\ning climate-related concerns in AI development and deployment,\nit falls short of establishing a comprehensive framework for mit-\nigating the environmental risks posed by AI systems. Key provi-\nsions on transparency and risk management for high-risk AI and\ngeneral-purpose AI systems make some progress in requiring doc-\numentation of computational resources and energy consumption,\nbut significant gaps remain. For example, the Act does not mandate\nthe disclosure of energy consumption during the inference phase,\na crucial omission given the long-term environmental impact of\nAI applications. Moreover, transparency measures are restricted to\nauthorities, limiting broader accountability and public scrutiny.\nAdditionally, while the Act imposes risk assessment and mitiga-\ntion obligations on providers of HRAI systems and GPAI models\nwith systemic risk, these provisions lack sufficient emphasis on\nenvironmental factors. Although environmental protection is in-\ncluded in the Act’s objectives, its practical integration into risk\nmanagement remains unclear and no detailed reporting on mitiga-\ntion efforts concerning environmental risks is currently required.\nWithout stronger enforcement and clearer guidance, particularly\non the inclusion of energy consumption and other environmen-\ntal impacts in risk assessments, the Act’s potential to address the\ngrowing climate-related risks of AI systems will remain limited.\n6 Operationalizing the Requirements\n6.1 Model Providers and their Access to\nInfrastructure\nLeading model providers leverage extensive supercomputer net-\nworks equipped with high-performance GPUs. This group is most\n\nAI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data Centers to the AI Act Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\nimpacted by energy consumption reporting. We assume that they\npossess privileged access or considerable influence over the utilized\ninfrastructure given their financial power or strategic value. One\ncan distinguish between companies that develop closed models (e.g.,\nOpenAI) and those that create open-source models (e.g., Meta).\nStartups and smaller companies are expected to either directly\ndeploy such models, use available API services of leading model\nproviders, or fine-tune existing models. Although these companies\ndo not typically train large models themselves, they must report\nenergy consumption for fine-tuning. Under our proposed inter-\npretation, however, only if the fine-tuning of a model leads to a\nsubstantial modification.\n6.2 Levels for Measuring and Estimating Energy\nConsumption\nThere are several levels within a data center based on which energy\nconsumption may be measured or estimated [4]. These include (1)\nthe data center level, (2) the cumulative server level, (3) the GPU-\nLevel and other hardware within a server and (4) various other\nlevels. In this section, we outline each level along with their bene-\nfits, drawbacks, and estimation methods for when measurement is\nunavailable.\n6.2.1 Data Center Level. On the data center level, the power re-\nquired to operate the entire data center is measured, including both\nthe direct power consumption of computing equipment and the\nadditional overhead for cooling and maintaining the data center.\nThis approach provides the most extensive and complete figures\nsince it represents the actual energy usage, but also assumes that a\ndata center is exclusively utilized for the pre-training by the model\nprovider. It encourages the selection of an efficient data center. Ad-\nditionally, data centers have average PUE values of 1.58, so this\noverhead makes up a significant portion of the energy consump-\ntion. On the other hand, the power usage resulting solely from the\nmodel’s architecture, the quantity of training data, the efficiency of\nthe implementation, and experimental settings is very important\nbut is somewhat skewed by the efficiency of the data center.\nIf data-center level power consumption measurement is not avail-\nable, using the PUE factor for estimation is deemed appropriate. To\ncalculate total energy usage, the PUE factor is multiplied by the raw\ncomputational power consumption measured or estimated at the cu-\nmulative server or rack level (see below). This might be reasonable,\nif only parts of a data center are utilized and only measurements\ncloser to the ICT equipment are available.\n6.2.2 Cumulative Server Level. A large-scale model is trained across\nmany servers in a distributed manner. Each server includes GPUs\nresponsible for the primary computation. To accurately monitor\nthe power consumption over time, a local power distribution unit\n(PDU), capable of measuring the provided power, is attached to each\nserver. Aggregating these measurements yields a highly precise\nfigure of the total energy consumption attributable to the model’s\ncomputations. Instead of aggregating local PDUs, the usage of pri-\nmary PDUs or uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems already\nmeasuring at the rack level or even many racks is also suitable\n(See also Appendix, Figure 1), as long as the measurements pre-\ncisely match fully the utilized hardware resources by the model\nproviders. The goal is to include all ICT-related power consumption\nbut exclude data center specific efficiency properties.\nThe upside of this method is its high accuracy, highly correlating\nwith model size and structure, data quantity, and hardware-aware\nsoftware implementation. It is widely recognized in the industry\nfor assessing power consumption in data centers. According to a\n2023 Green Grid industry survey [77], 66% of data centers can track\npower demand at least on rack-level. Roughly one third of over-\nall data centers are already able to collect average utilization and\npower demand data for individual servers and storage equipment\nand match this data to their IT equipment inventory. We assume\nthat the data centers that are used for training by large model\nproviders are already able to track this information given its high\ncost relevance. However, a significant number of data centers do not\ntrack power demand yet. The surveyed data center professionals\nestimate to require between 3-6 months (Europe: 15%, Global: 19%),\n1 year (Europe: 29%, Global: 28%), 2 years (Europe: 12%, Global:\n10%), 3 years (Europe: 4%, Global: 4%) or more than 4 years (Europe:\n11%, Global: 8%) to implement adequate power collection abilities.\nFor European data centers these numbers stand in (surprising) con-\ntrast to the obligation under the EED and Delegated Regulation to\nprovide energy consumption data by Sep 15, 2024 (Art. 3(1) and\nAnnex II(1)(e) Delegated Regulation). Either a substantial number\nof the participants was unaware of the obligations; or thereby ac-\nknowledged their inability to comply in time; or the question was\ntoo narrow, being pointed at individual servers, while the EED also\nallows measurement at the higher-level UPS.\nAn estimation is possible when GPU hours and the hardware\nused are known. By multiplying a GPU-hour with the peak utiliza-\ntion power consumption specified by the manufacturer, one can\nestimate the upper limit of energy consumption at the server level.\nThis upper bound is typically higher than the actual consumption,\nas GPU utilization rarely reaches its theoretical peak due to other\nresource constraints. Higher GPU efficiency means that the same\noperations are completed in less time, reducing the overhead from\nnon-utilization-dependent hardware power consumption.\n6.2.3 GPU-Level and other hardware within a server. The mea-\nsurement may be based on the energy usage of particular compo-\nnents as determined by on-chip sensors. Nvidia GPUs and certain\nCPUs already provide straightforward power consumption moni-\ntoring, therefore estimations are usually not necessary. However,\ndespite GPU power consumption being a significant factor and its\nusage correlating with the total power usage, it substantially under-\nrepresents the actual energy consumption since it measures just a\nsingle component. CPU power usage is a relatively minor factor in\nconsumption. Most other server components cannot be measured.\nWe advocate against using GPU-level or other component-based\npower consumption tracking for overall energy measurements.\n6.2.4 Other levels. Other measurement levels, such as Workload,\nCloud Instance, or Virtual Machine, involve high complexity and\nnumerous assumptions, resulting in a lack of standardized mea-\nsurement or estimation methods with considerable uncertainty. We\nadvise against using these levels for power consumption tracking.\n6.2.5 Interim Conclusion on the Level of Measurement. In our anal-\nysis, we argue that energy consumption should be measured and\n\nConference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Kai Ebert, Nicolas Alder, Ralf Herbrich, and Philipp Hacker\nreported at the cumulative server level (see also [4]). This approach\ncaptures the total computation-related power usage and is better\nsuited to help providers optimize their AI models and algorithms for\nenergy efficiency. Additionally, the PUE factor of each data center,\nwhich is reported and published by the data center operator under\nthe Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) 2023/1791 and Delegated Reg-\nulation (EU) 2024/1364, provides a useful estimate of overall energy\nconsumption [4]. With these two figures, it is possible to distinguish\nbetween model-specific power usage (server-level computation)\nand the data center’s efficiency, offering a clearer picture of the\ntotal energy investment [4]. Although the EED mandates that PUE\nfactors must be available for data centers situated within the EU,\nthe responsibility of reporting these factors should also fall on the\nmodel provider. Specifically, model providers utilizing data center\nfacilities outside the EU should not be granted an exemption.\nEstimates of server-level power consumption should be based\non peak utilization figures provided by the hardware manufacturer\n(e.g., Nvidia) [4]. Still, it is important to consider advancements in\nresearch. Interpretation of the legal requirements could accommo-\ndate justifiable alternative assumptions that may not require peak\nutilization figures. For instance, tracking GPU utilization through\ninterfaces like those provided by Nvidia and referencing hardware\nbenchmarks based on specific GPU utilization rates could serve as\na basis for such assumptions.\n6.3 Measurement or Estimation\nAlthough actual measurement is more onerous, it also yields more\nprecise results for energy consumption reporting. Major model\nproviders are likely to already measure power consumption as it\nis a primary cost factor and highly linked to computational power.\nDespite the availability of power consumption data, companies\nmay be tempted to use estimated values to protect sensitive infor-\nmation. This practice should be restricted by legally prioritizing\nmeasurements over estimations in Annex XI Section 1(2)(e).\nThe same reasoning applies to smaller entities relying on cloud\ncomputing services for fine-tuning, for example such offered by\nAmazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. Fine-tuning is crucial\nfor employing foundational models in task-specific applications\nand tailoring them to specific datasets. The higher the expense\nof initial model trainings, the stronger the incentive to perform\nfine-tuning rather than retraining the model. Therefore, this is the\ntype of adaptation that most businesses will focus on to effectively\nintegrate large AI models into practical products.\nCloud platforms still lack client-oriented power consumption\nreporting as part of their products. It is essential that ordinary\ncompanies with limited resources do not face obstacles in fulfill-\ning their reporting obligations only because their cloud computing\nproviders do not offer this data. The access rights enshrined in Art.\n25(2) AI Act can help if the deploying entity becomes a provider—\nbut providers may invoke trade secrets and IP rights to dilute this\nobligation (Art. 25(5) AI Act). In our view, the interests of down-\nstream actors in reporting correct figures should generally trump\nthe secrecy interests of upstream providers, in this case. Under the\ncurrent setup, companies could always resort to computation-based\nestimations for their reporting. However, in order to gain the most\naccurate data, cloud platforms should be incentivized to provide\nenergy consumption data to their clients. Complementing Art. 25(2)\nAI Act, the obligation established in Sec. 15 of the German Energy\nEfficiency Act, requiring data centers to inform customers on their\nattributable annual energy consumption, could serve as a blueprint.\nNotably, such a law could also apply to cloud service providers\nbased outside the EU, with the caveat, however, that such an ex-\ntraterritorial application oftentimes lacks enforcement capabilities.\n6.4 Sustainability Impact Assessments\nThe operationalization of sustainability impact assessments (SIAs)\nwithin the risk assessments required under the AI Act involves\nintegrating environmental considerations into the existing risk\nmanagement frameworks that high-risk AI model providers and\nGPAI providers must follow. Much like data protection or algo-\nrithmic impact assessments, SIAs would serve as a practical tool\nfor embedding climate considerations into the development and\ndeployment of AI systems. Importantly, these assessments should\nnot be limited to high-risk AI models but should also apply to all AI\nsystems, regardless of the associated risk to health or safety. This\nis because the carbon footprint of AI models is often unrelated to\ntheir classification as high or low risk under the Act. Therefore, an\nSIA could ensure that environmental impacts are considered across\nthe entire AI landscape.\nThe SIA should involve evaluating various models and design\nchoices during the development process, comparing them not only\non their performance but also on their estimated environmental\nimpact. For instance, developers would need to assess whether a\nsimpler model, like linear regression or even a non-AI model, could\nachieve similar results with a smaller carbon footprint compared\nto more complex models like deep learning [33, 37]. Similarly, the\ndecision to use large, pre-trained models or training new, narrow\nmodels (almost) from scratch should factor in the potential climate\nbenefits. By using existing tools to measure the carbon impact of AI\nmodels, developers would be required to opt for the more environ-\nmentally sustainable option when performance is comparable. To\neffectively implement sustainability impact assessments, providers\nwould need to establish standardized methodologies for measuring\nthe environmental effects of AI models, particularly energy and\nwater usage during training and inference phases.\nTaking one step back, the concept of \"data protection by design\"\nshould be expanded to include “sustainability by design, ” under\nwhich developers should actively seek to reduce the contribution\nof ICT, including AI, to climate change [33]. At both the technical\nand organizational levels, this would involve adopting all feasible\nmeasures to limit environmental impact, a shift that has already\nbeen applied in other industries through consumption practices\nand product design. These approaches are also gaining traction in\nsupply chain management and other sectors in pursuit of corpo-\nrate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives. By\ndrawing on these existing practices, sustainability by design could\nbecome a core principle guiding the regulation of the ICT and AI\nsectors.\n\nAI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data Centers to the AI Act Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\n7 Policy Proposals\nAlthough the AI Act attempts to address climate concerns through\nvarious reporting obligations, these measures largely lack consis-\ntency and clarity. We identify twelve policy recommendations that\nshould be integrated into the evaluation report due in August 2028\n(Article 111(6)), as well as any interpretive guidelines from the AI\nOffice and other agencies, and in reviews and potential textual\nrevisions prior to that date (see also [4]). These measures can be\ngrouped in four categories: Energy and Environmental Reporting\nObligations; Legal and Regulatory Clarifications; Transparency and\nAccountability Mechanisms; and Future Far-Reaching Measures\nbeyond Transparency.\n7.1 Energy and Environmental Reporting\nObligations\nThe current AI Act overlooks key environmental factors related to\nAI systems [56]. The following proposals aim to ensure comprehen-\nsive energy and environmental accountability for AI systems, both\nfor development and inference phases.\n• Inclusion of Energy Consumption From Inferences: We\npropose an interpretation that would at least bring energy\nconsumption for single inferences back into the scope (see\nalso [4]). Adoption of this interpretation by courts, author-\nities and industry, however, is uncertain. Therefore, both\nsingle and overall inferences should be included as a report-\ning category in Annex XI and Annex XII (vis-à-vis authorities\nand downstream providers) through delegated acts from the\nCommission (Articles 53(5) and (6)) and future recommenda-\ntions from the AI Office.\n• Indirect Emissions and Water Consumption Reporting:\nThe Act currently omits indirect emissions from AI applica-\ntions (e.g., those used for oil and gas exploration [37]) and\nwater consumption [49]. Reporting should include: Providers\nreporting water usage, and deployers reporting application-\nrelated emissions, allowing for estimates where precise mea-\nsurements are impossible, particularly when dealing with\nfuture scenarios.\n• Energy Reporting at the Cumulative Server Level : En-\nergy consumption should be reported at the cumulative\nserver level (see also [4]). In this endeavor, estimations may\nbe used only when direct measurements are unavailable.\nThese principles should guide the development of technical\nstandards under Article 40 of the AI Act, as well as the po-\ntential implementation of the Global Digital Compact on a\nglobal scale.\n7.2 Legal and Regulatory Clarifications on AI\nModels and Providers\nAmbiguities in the AI Act regarding provider responsibilities for\nAI models need to be clarified to ensure that entities know when\nand what to comply with. The following proposals seek ensure that\ncompanies understand their obligations, that open-source models\nare on par with closed models, and that the regulatory framework\nsets effective incentives at the source (data centers) to mitigate the\nenvironmental impact of AI model development and deployment.\n• Clarifying Provider Status for Model Modifications :\nThe current definition of provider status needs to focus on\nsubstantial modifications to AI models, specifically those that\ninvolve changing the model’s weights. Reporting obligations\nand the change-of-provider threshold should be tied to com-\nputational costs incurred during significant modifications,\nwith a minimum computational cost threshold ensuring that\nonly energy-intensive changes trigger additional reporting\n[4].\n• Elimination of the Open-Source Exemption : The open-\nsource exemption from reporting obligations should be re-\nmoved, as making parts of a model public does not justify ex-\nclusion from environmental accountability [4]. Open-source\nmodels can have significant energy implications and should\nadhere to the same reporting standards as proprietary mod-\nels.\n• Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Targets for\nData Centers: The EED and Delegated Regulation should\nbe amended in three regards, following the German Energy\nEfficiency Act: they should set binding efficiency targets\n(PUE) and renewable energy targets for data centers; and\ninclude an information obligation for data center operators\nand cloud service providers vis-à-vis their customers regard-\ning the attributable energy consumption. These measures\nshould be included in the 2025 evaluation report. This would\nboth increase transparency and facilitate more sustainable\ndecisions by market participants.\n7.3 Transparency and Accountability\nMechanisms\nTo promote public trust and accountability in AI’s environmental\nimpact, the following measures are recommended:\n• Public Access to Climate-Related Disclosures: All climate-\nrelated disclosures, including energy consumption, should\nbe made accessible to the general public [4]. If only aggregate\ndata are shared, trade secrets can be protected while allowing\nfor public scrutiny by analysts, academics, and NGOs. Pub-\nlic transparency would drive market pressure, reputational\nincentives, and public accountability; it would, arguably, en-\ncourage companies to reduce their environmental impact.\n• Energy Reporting for High-Risk AI (HRAI) : For High-\nRisk AI (HRAI) systems, the Act should require the disclosure\nof energy consumption rather than computational resources\nto eliminate inaccuracies and enhance comparability.\n• Environmental Risk Assessments: Providers should be\nrequired to include environmental risks in their risk assess-\nments. The language in Art. 1(1) and Recital 1, as well as Art.\n9 and 55 AI Act should be clarified to reflect this. This will\nensure that environmental impacts are systematically eval-\nuated alongside other risks during AI system development\nand deployment.\n7.4 Beyond Transparency\nIn addition to the existing proposals, more far-reaching measures\nthat go beyond reporting and transparency may need to be con-\nsidered in the future, particularly as AI’s energy demands grow.\n\nConference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Kai Ebert, Nicolas Alder, Ralf Herbrich, and Philipp Hacker\nThe following proposals focus on reducing AI’s strain on energy\nresources and fostering more sustainable energy practices:\n• Restrictions on AI Training and Inference During Peak\nHours: One future measure could involve limiting AI train-\ning and certain inference tasks (e.g., those for recreation-\nrelated purposes) to non-peak energy demand hours [ 33].\nThis would reduce the strain on energy grids during peak\ntimes and make AI energy usage more manageable and sus-\ntainable.\n• Obligations for Data Centers and AI Companies to Cre-\nate Renewable Energy Sources : AI companies and data\ncenters should be required to create new renewable energy\nsources to offset any excess energy demand caused by their\noperations. This measure could help ensure that renewable\nenergy, which is a finite resource, is not monopolized by AI\nand data centers, leaving enough clean energy for the rest of\nthe industry. Clear definitions and guidelines would need to\nbe established to define which types of energy consumption\nwould be covered by this ’new source requirement’.\n• Tradable Energy Budgets for AI : Another possible long-\nterm measure could involve implementing tradable energy\nbudgets for AI, similar to the EU Emissions Trading Sys-\ntem (EU ETS) [ 33]. Companies that consume particularly\nlarge amounts of energy would have a capped energy budget\nfor AI operations and could trade these credits. This would\ncreate a market-based approach to managing and reducing\nAI-related energy consumption. It would, arguably, encour-\nage companies to optimize their energy usage and invest in\nenergy efficiency.\n8 Objections and Solutions\nImplementing the proposed policy recommendations presents both\npractical and political challenges, particularly given the EU’s broader\nregulatory landscape and the evolving international context. This\nsection outlines four key objections to our proposals and sketches\nsolutions. First, a central priority of the new European Commis-\nsion is the simplification of the digital acquis (‘fitness check’) [59].\nThere is concern that adding further reporting requirements and\nregulatory obligations could create administrative burdens that\ncounteract this goal. However, several of our proposals, particularly\nstandardized energy reporting metrics and clearer environmental\nrisk assessments, align with the EU’s push for regulatory clarity\nand streamlining. Rather than adding complexity, these measures\nwould, arguably, make compliance more predictable and feasible.\nSecond, the shifting international AI governance landscape cre-\nates uncertainty regarding the feasibility of ambitious environmen-\ntal rules. There is concern that EU regulatory efforts might face\nresistance from international AI providers or risk competitive dis-\nadvantages. While acknowledging a trend toward deregulation in\nsome corners of the world, we argue that this reinforces the need\nfor robust EU policy leadership. The AI Act’s extraterritorial scope\nalready compels global AI providers to comply with EU regula-\ntions when operating in the European market. By introducing clear,\nenforceable environmental obligations, the EU can set a global reg-\nulatory precedent, and shape international norms despite external\npressures. Moreover, some of our proposals - such as market-based\nmechanisms for energy efficiency - offer flexible compliance path-\nways that may be more politically acceptable in a deregulatory\nglobal environment.\nThird, the AI industry, particularly large-scale AI providers and\ndata center operators, may resist additional regulatory obligations,\nciting economic and technological constraints. There is also concern\nthat lack of enforcement mechanisms could render some obligations\nineffective. Hence, our proposals emphasize practical enforcement\nstrategies, including gradual implementation, industry incentives,\nand transparency-driven accountability. For example: public access\nto climate-related disclosures can create reputational incentives\nfor compliance, even in the absence of strict enforcement; energy\nefficiency targets for data centers can be phased in over time for a\nrealistic transition without abrupt regulatory shocks; clarifications\non provider status and reporting obligations offer legal certainty to\ncompanies. Fourth, some of our more ambitious proposals - such as\ntradable energy budgets for AI or restrictions on AI training during\npeak hours - may be viewed as far-reaching or difficult to implement\nin the near term. While we recognize that not all proposals will\nbe immediately adopted, it is crucial to articulate ambitious policy\noptions at this juncture. The AI regulatory landscape is evolving,\nand incremental steps toward long-term measures can be integrated\ninto future evaluation rounds of the AI Act, the EED, and related\nframeworks. As with the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), ini-\ntial skepticism toward market-based environmental regulations can\ngive way to gradual acceptance as regulatory mechanisms mature.\nGiven the current political momentum and upcoming AI Act eval-\nuation rounds, there is a narrow but critical window to influence\nenvironmental AI governance. While not all recommendations will\nbe immediately adopted, presenting a structured, well-argued pol-\nicy package ensures that sustainability concerns remain central to\nAI regulation in the EU and beyond - rather than being sidelined in\nthe face of deregulation.\n9 Conclusion\nAI systems, many of them containing energy-intensive generative\nAI components, are increasingly integrated into economic and soci-\netal processes. Importantly, as AI intersects with robotics, writing\ncode and steering devices, it is poised to merge decisively into\nindustrial processes, proliferating its deployment, but also its cli-\nmate effects. Currently, this intersection between the AI and the\ngreen transition sits at a regulatory blind spot, inadequately ad-\ndressed in current regulation. In this paper, we take a closer look at\nsustainability-related data center regulation and the sustainability\nprovisions in the AI Act. While they present a good first step, they\ntoo often lack ambition, clarity and consistency, or present signifi-\ncant challenges in implementation. To counter these shortcomings,\nwe provide interpretations of the AI Act in line with its purpose of\nenvironmental protection, provide guidance on operationalizing the\nrequirements, and make twelve concrete proposals, grouped into\nfour areas: Energy and Environmental Reporting Obligations; Legal\nand Regulatory Clarifications; Transparency and Accountability;\nand Future Far-Reaching Measures beyond Transparency.\nReferences\n[1] Nicolas Alder and Ralf Herbrich. 2024.

This inherently intertwines\nthe digital transformation with questions of climate change, partic-\nularly concerning the energy and water consumption of AI models.\nThese features are attracting attention from both the public and\nacademia (see below, 2.). Concerns are growing that the supply\nof renewable energy may not keep up with their increasing de-\nmand triggered by the AI scaling race [4] in which the EU is poised\nto join the U.S. and China under the EU Commission’s new AI\nContinent Action Plan [25]. Scholars and activists, in turn, are in-\ncreasingly critiquing and situating digital technology within the\nframework of environmental justice [28, 40, 67, 72, 81]. Work in po-\nlitical economy has shed a light on the extractive nature of AI-based\nsocio-technical systems, extracting and, at times, exploiting, both\nnatural and human resources [18, 24, 39, 42, 58], often particularly\nfrom marginalized communities [61, 65] and regions [50, 80]. Both\nthe quest for performance and the funding logic behind AI force\nproviders to scale them to a point where this trajectory may push\nagainst planetary limits [8–10, 18].\nRegulatory frameworks are beginning to address these chal-\nlenges, too. While the new U.S. administration scraps environmen-\ntal rules and generally deregulates, the EU Artificial Intelligence\nAct (AI Act) becomes applicable as the world’s most comprehensive\nattempt at direct AI regulation. It features environmental protection\nas one of its core goals and contains dedicated sustainability rules,\nwhich also apply to US and other non-EU providers offering models\nin the EU. Similarly, the Digital Services Act (DSA) compels Very\nLarge Online Platforms and Very Large Online Search Engines to\nthoroughly assess and mitigate systemic risks, which is of particu-\nlar relevance for hybrid platforms increasingly integrating AI. As\nscholars have pointed out, this includes climate and sustainabil-\nity risks [11], and intersects partially with obligations under the\nAI Act [32, 36]. In parallel, the Energy Efficiency Directive (EU)\n2023/1791 introduces transparency obligations for data centers, a\ncritical infrastructure supporting AI. However, these regulatory in-\nstruments were developed independently, leading to fragmentation\nand gaps. The AI Act originally pursued climate-related objectives\nespecially in the European Parliament’s position of June 2023, but\nover successive drafts and the trilogue negotiations, its environ-\nmental provisions were diluted, particularly with regard to energy\nconsumption from AI inference and risk assessments.

Our twelve policy proposals address four key\nareas: Energy and Environmental Reporting Obligations; Legal and\nRegulatory Clarifications; Transparency and Accountability Mech-\nanisms; and Future Far-Reaching Measures beyond Transparency.\n2 Related Work\nDue to the interdisciplinary nature of sustainable AI, related works\noriginate from three main fields—computer science; humanities and\npolicy; and legal research. In recent years, the computer science and\nAI community has become increasingly aware of the environmental\neffects of AI, which led to both policy-oriented [ 8, 14, 29, 37, 44,\n45, 52, 54, 56, 70, 76] and technical contributions, particularly on\nthe environmental effects of data centers operations and AI-related\ncomputing [2, 30, 62], studies for tracking [1, 19, 23, 51, 53, 55, 64, 79,\n82] and techniques for reducing the emissions of data centers and AI\nmodels [7, 31, 43, 46, 57]. The water consumption of AI training has\nalso been a concern [49, 83]. Broader scholarship and policy work\nincludes ethical [15, 27], informational [20, 54, 63, 75], and social\nperspectives [6]. Numerous contributions also analyze and evaluate\nthe various means in which AI may be used to mitigate, and adapt to,\nclimate change [13, 17, 34, 41, 47, 68, 69, 75], as also acknowledged in\nthe AI Act (Recitals 4 and 142). However, from a legal perspective,\nthe problem of sustainable AI remains underexplored. Existing\ncontributions date from before the AI Act’s final version [63], which\ndiffers significantly from previous proposals (see below, 5.2.) or do\nnot engage with its provisions in detail [33]. Other, complimentary\nwork focuses uniquely on the DSA [11] or data center regulation\n[16].\n3 Technical Background\nFrom a technical perspective, it is important to distinguish between\n(pre-)training, fine-tuning, and inference. Training refers to the\nprocess of initially adjusting a model’s parameters or weights to\nfit the data. This process is highly compute-intensive and typically\nrequires a significant amount of energy [37, 53, 55, 79]. LLM perfor-\nmance strongly depends on the model scale (number of parameters),\nwhich in turn requires more training data [38, 66], and hence more\nresources. Such scaling can even be expected with algorithmically\nadvanced models, such as DeepSeek R1 [3].\nFine-tuning aims at adjusting a pretrained model to fit more\nspecific data in order to perform better at specific tasks. It involves\na significantly smaller amount of training data and compute budget.\nThe specific procedure for successful fine-tuning is very model-,\ndata-, and task-specific, and rather empirical. Therefore, the com-\nputational and energy-intensity can vary significantly for this step.\nFor example, as highlighted by Luccioni et al. [55], the energy usage\nfor fine-tuning the Bloomz-7B required 7,571 kWh compared to\n51,686 kWh for the entire training process, adding another 15 % to\nthe initial consumption. Inference, in turn, refers to the procedure\nof generating a prediction from a trained model. Typically, an indi-\nvidual inference consumes little energy compared to training; but\nthere are many more inference than training events.\nMost of these training, fine-tuning and inference computations\nare conducted in data centers. The power usage effectiveness (PUE)\nmetric reflects the energy efficiency of a data center. It indicates\nthe ratio of the total energy needed by a data center, including\ncomponents such as cooling, to the energy used solely by computa-\ntional devices. A PUE of 1.0 would imply ideal efficiency, meaning\nthat the data center uses only the energy necessary to power the\ncomputational devices. The average data center PUE in 2023 was\n1.58 globally[74] and 1.6 in the EU [26].\n4 Regulation of Data Centers\nData centers run all kinds of operations, such as cloud computing,\ncrypto currencies and the Internet at large. Recently, AI training\nand inference have experienced massive growth. Broad data center\nregulation, therefore, indirectly governs the environmental effects\nof AI and constitutes the backdrop against which specific AI regu-\nlation must be viewed. Taking a look at the requirements for data\ncenters can help to find a coherent and effective interpretation of\nthe requirements in the AI Act as it builds on already available data\nand established methodology.", "sentences": [{"text": "Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Kai Ebert, Nicolas Alder, Ralf Herbrich, and Philipp Hacker\nthe EU’s data center regulation remains incomplete,

USA\n4.1 EU Data Collection and Reporting\nObligations for Data Centers\nIn the EU, data collection and reporting obligations for data centers\nwere established by two recent legal acts, Art. 12 of the recast\nEnergy Efficiency Directive EU/2023/1791 of September 13, 2023\n(\"EED\"), and the Commission Delegated Regulation EU/2024/1364\nof March 14, 2024 (\"Delegated Regulation\"). The new rules apply\nto all data centers in the EU with a power demand of the installed\ninformation technology (IT) of at least 500kW, which includes small-\nsized data centers. Data center operators are required to collect,\nmake publicly available and report to a EU database information\nthat is deemed relevant for the sustainability assessment of the data\ncenters and the industry as a whole. The reporting is mandated on\nan annual basis.\nThe required data includes energy consumption, power utiliza-\ntion, temperature set points, waste heat utilisation, water usage\nand use of renewable energy (EED, Annex VII(c)). Notably, while\nthe EED focuses on energy and power, the reporting of water usage\nis a significant step forward as both energy and water consumption\nhave raised concerns in AI settings [49, 55]. In addition, the Water\nFramework Directive can be harnessed to limit the overall amount\nwater a data center may consume, and also control for any potential\nloss of water quality [33].\nThe Delegated Regulation provides specific key performance\nindicators and methodology. Most notable is the requirement to\nmeasure and report the energy consumption of the installed infor-\nmation technology. Following the standard-methodology for the\ncalculation of PUE,1 the energy consumption must be measured at\nthe uninterruptible power system (UPS) or, if not existent, at the\npower distribution unit (PDU) or at another point specified by the\ndata center (see Delegated Regulation, Annex II(1)(e); see also the\nappendix, Figure 1 as Categories 1-3.\nThe data centers must report to the EU database directly or\nvia a national reporting scheme, if such a scheme is implemented\nby the Member State. From the reported data the Commission\ncalculates the data center sustainability indicators which are made\npublicly available on an aggregate level. They include the power\nusage effectiveness (PUE), the water usage effectiveness (WUE)2,\nthe energy reuse factor (ERF) 3, and the renewable energy factor\n(REF)4.\n4.2 Energy Management Systems and Energy\nAudits\nThe EED also requires that Member States mandate companies\nwith an average annual energy consumption of more than 10 TJ to\nconduct an energy audit at least every four years and those with a\nconsumption of more than 85 TJ to implement an energy manage-\nment system including regular energy audits (Art. 11 EED). This\nwould also apply to operators of data centers. The Directive sets\n1The Delegated Regulation refers to the European standard CEN/CENELEC EN 50600-\n4-2.\n2WUE measures the amount of water used in the data center’s cooling and other\noperations relative to the energy consumed by the IT stack.\n3ERF represents the percentage of energy that is reused from a data center’s waste\nenergy, showing the efficiency of energy recovery.\n4REF indicates the proportion of a data center’s energy that comes from renewable\nsources.\nup certain minimum criteria for energy audits (Annex VI EED) and\nrefers to the relevant international or European standards (Recital\n80 EED). The legal minimum criteria, however, do not dictate how\nenergy consumption should be measured.\n4.3 German 2023 Energy Efficiency Act\nIn Germany, the Energy Efficiency Act of 8 Nov 2023 implements\nthe EED and establishes a national reporting scheme and additional\nrequirements, including specific efficiency and renewable energy\ntargets for data centers. The Act broadens the scope of the report-\ning obligation to include even smaller data centers, upwards of 300\nkW (Sec. 13). It also expands the duty to set up an energy manage-\nment system to data centers and operators of ICT—i.e., customers\nof colocation data centers—of more than 50 kW (Sec. 12). Most im-\nportantly, it sets targets on energy efficiency and renewable energy\nuse, requiring data centers to reach a PUE factor between 1.5 and\n1.2 and an ERF of 10% to 20 % depending on their age (Sec. 11), and\nto run on 50 % renewable energy, increasing that factor to 100% by 1\nJan 2027 (Sec. 11). Lastly, it requires data center operators to inform\ntheir customers on an annual basis on the energy consumption\ndirectly attributable to them (Sec. 15).\n4.4 Regulation Outside the EU\nOutside the EU, a number of countries is taking the lead by im-\nplementing concrete PUE goals, such as Singapore, Japan, China,\nand Australia, while the U.S. as one of the main contributors in\nthe AI race shows a nuanced picture. However, it should be noted\nthat some of these measures are limited to procurement policies or\nmere political commitments where it is unclear if there will be any\npenalty-enabled enforcement like in the German Energy Efficiency\nAct. A direct comparison of PUE target values should, therefore, be\nmade with this caveat in mind.\nUnder the 2024 Green Data Center Roadmap, Singapore aims\nto reach a PUE of 1.3 or less within 10 years [ 71]. Japan, with its\n2022 Energy Conservation Act, requires data center operators to\ntake efficiency measures to reach a target PUE of 1.4 by 2030 [12].\nMeanwhile, in China, according to Li et al., policies issued from\n2013 onward introduced efficiency targets, gradually decreasing\nthe required PUE from 1.5 in 2013 to 1.3 in 2021 [48]. However, the\nauthors also admit that most recent data still shows a significant\nimplementation gap with the actual PUE of most data centers rang-\ning between 1.4 and 2.0. As part of Australia’s 2023 Net Zero in\nGovernment Operations Strategy, data center services procured by\nthe government must demonstrate a five-star energy rating under\nthe national NABERS scheme, including a PUE of 1.4 or lower. This\nrequirement applies to procurement from members of the distin-\nguished Data Centre Panel, and from 1 July 2025, it will extend to\nother companies and state-operated data centers [21].\nIn the U.S., in the absence of federal efficiency requirements, the\nonly direct regulation for data center efficiency is the California\nGreen Building Action Plan 2015 implementing Executive Order B-\n18-12. Data centers that exceed a PUE of 1.5 are required to reduce\ntheir PUE by a minimum of 10 percent per year until they achieve\na 1.5 or lower PUE. However, similar to the Australian action, this\nplan is only limited to state data centers [22, 73].", "sentences": [{"text": "AI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data Centers to the AI Act

Note that other operationally relevant actors, such as cloud\nservice providers, data providers, data center operators, or other\nintermediaries, are not directly subject to AI Act rules.\nThe Act pays specific attention to general-purpose AI (GPAI)\nmodels, e.g., large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, that are\ndefined by the wide range of possible uses.

From Data Centers to the AI Act Conference’17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\nRecital 109). Hence, there is a palpable incentive for companies to\navoid provider status.\nConcerning HRAI systems, pursuant to Art. 25(1), deployers can\nbecome providers if they market an existing HRAI system under\ntheir name or trademark, substantially modify an HRAI system, or\nchange the intended purpose of a non-high-risk AI system such\nthat it falls under one of the high-risk sectors (e.g., employment;\nlife- or health insurance; education). Specifically, if a deployer uses\na GPAI system, such as ChatGPT, in a high-risk setting, for example,\nby harnessing it for resume screening in hiring, they automatically\nassume the responsibilities of a provider of an HRAI system (Art.\n25(1)(c)).\nAn existing HRAI system can be altered. If the modification is\nsubstantial, the modifying entity becomes a new provider (Article\n25(1)(b)). It is unclear, however, what precisely constitutes a \"sub-\nstantial modification\" that would trigger provider status for the\nmodifying entity. A formal interpretation suggests that any change\nto the model could be deemed substantial, based on Art. 3(23), which\ndefines substantial modification as any unplanned change affect-\ning compliance or intended purpose. On the other hand, a—more\nconvincing—material interpretation would claim that provider sta-\ntus should only apply if the modification increases the model’s\nrisk in a nonnegligible way. This aligns with the AI Act’s focus on\nrisk mitigation and also the language in Article 3(23) according to\nwhich any significant modification must affect compliance with the\nhigh-risk rules of the Act (or change the purpose).\nFor GPAI models, Recitals 97, 109, and 111 suggest that any\nentity performing even minimal fine-tuning of a GPAI model is\nautomatically classified as the provider of a new model, including\nall associated responsibilities [4]. For minor modifications this is\ndisproportionate, even if Recital 109 states that obligations are\nlimited to the fine-tuning itself [4]. A solution could be an analogy\nwith Article 25(1)(b) so that provider status would only be triggered\nby a substantial modification made through fine-tuning, rather than\nany minor changes [4].\nThis is particularly important for SMEs using powerful mod-\nels (GPAI models with systemic risk): if they become providers,\nthey need to comply with the much more stringent obligations in\nArticle 55 concerning evaluation and risk management, including\nenvironmental risk.\n5.2 Legislative History and Intent\nIn the original Commission proposal of April 2021, the AI Act only\nincluded minimal references to environmental effects, mostly as a\npotential benefit to climate change mitigation (see above, 2.), and\nin the section on voluntary commitments [ 63]. The General Ap-\nproach adopted by the Council in December 2022 continued this\nnarrow framing. However, the momentum changed, particularly\nwith the position of the European Parliament (EP), published in\nJune 2023. The suggested EP sustainability amendments to the AI\nAct introduce environmental principles for AI development, prefer-\nential funding for eco-friendly AI, mandatory energy and resource\nconsumption reporting, sustainability risk assessments (SIAs) for\nfoundation models, and Commission-led guidance on environmen-\ntal impact measurement and review [33]. During the final trilogue\nnegotiations, several of these amendments were dropped (e.g., the\nprinciple; explicit SIAs). However, simultaneously, the impact of\nfundamental rights was strengthened, and environmental protec-\ntion listed as one such right that must be considered in a range of\nprovisions [33, 63]. This is supported by the mention of environ-\nmental protection as a key policy goal of the AI Act in Article 1\nand Recitals 1, 2 and 8.\n5.3 Transparency\nThe first climate-related obligation in the AI Act concerns trans-\nparency and reporting, however not with respect to data centers,\nbut concerning providers of high-risk and GPAI models [ 4]. Yet,\nthe rules come with significant ambiguities and loopholes. In the\nfollowing, we detail the six most important ones.\n1) For high-risk AI systems, pursuant to Article 11(1) providers\nmust document the computational resources utilized during the\ndevelopment, training, testing, and validation stages, as outlined in\nAnnex IV(2) which does, however, not include the energy consump-\ntion directly [4]. This omission hinders the capacity to evaluate and\ncompare the environmental impact of such systems accurately. As\na result, the environmental footprint must be estimated indirectly\nbased on the recorded computational resources.\n2) The AI Act requires providers of general-purpose AI models\nto meet transparency obligations. Article 53(1)(a) mandates that\nproviders maintain up-to-date technical documentation, including\nthe details outlined in Annex XI. This annex requires the reporting\nof energy consumption, whether known or estimated, while esti-\nmates may be based on the computational resources used. However,\nthis requirement exhibits a significant gap as it only covers the\nenergy used during the model’s development phase, but leaves out\nthe inference phase [4]. Recent research has shown that energy con-\nsumption during inference often exceeds that of the development\nphase very significantly over time [55, 79].\nTo bridge this gap, we propose an alternative interpretation,\nbased on the information provided to downstream actors (see also\n[4]). As a result of the AI Act, providers must supply downstream\ndevelopers and relevant authorities with technical information on\nhow to incorporate GPAI models into AI systems (Articles 53(1)(a)\nand (b), together with Annex XI and Annex XII). While energy\nconsumption is not explicitly referenced in these provisions, they\ncould reasonably be understood to include details about the com-\nputational resources required for inference because downstream\nproviders need this information to properly allocate resources, e.g.,\npurchasing computing power for operating the model. As a side-\neffect, this information could be used to calculate energy consump-\ntion for individual inferences. However, to calculate the overall\nenergy consumption for inferences, the total number of inferences\nwould need to be available as well. While the typical energy costs of\ninferences should therefore be mandatorily disclosed by providers,\ndeployers should be compelled to divulge information on the num-\nber of inferences, as well, e.g., on an aggregate monthly level.\n3) Open-source (OS) GPAI models are largely excluded from\ntransparency requirements unless they present a systemic risk,\nas outlined in Articles 2(12) and 53(2) [ 4]. The idea is that OS\nmodels, by definition, already disclose certain types of informa-\ntion. Hence, Recital 102 lists information on parameters, including\nweights, model architecture, and model usage as a prerequisite for", "sentences": [{"text": "AI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data

Indeed, the AI Act\ndoes contain some language to this effect. For providers of GPAI\nmodels with systemic risk and providers of HRAI systems, the Act\nmandates risk assessment and mitigation (Art. 55(1)(b) and Art. 9).\nWe argue that these measures should also consider environmental\nrisks, in keeping with the normative goals of the AI Act listed in\nArticle 1 and Recitals 1, 2 and 8.\nCrucially, both provisions relate to risks of the AI model or sys-\ntem for fundamental rights which, within the AI Act, must be inter-\npreted as including environmental risks [5]. In Art. 1(1) and Recital\n1, the purpose of the AI Act is defined as protecting health, safety,\nfundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy,\nthe rule of law and environmental protection. However, in the doc-\ntrine of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\n(the Charter), environmental protection (Art. 37 of the Charta) is\nmerely an objective rule, not a fundamental right [60]. Democracy\nand the rule of law are not enshrined in a particular Article of the\nCharter but serve as guiding principles that permeate the Charter\nand all of the fundamental rights. Accordingly, they (only) find a\nmention in the preamble of the Charter.\nIn our view, the European legislator did not err on the doctri-\nnal classification of democracy, the rule of law and environmental\nprotection in the Charter by including these principles. While it is\nconceivable that a legislative error may have occurred in miscate-\ngorising the objective rule in Art. 37 of the Charta, that seems very\nunlikely for the basic principles merely expressed in the preamble.\nInstead, the more convincing interpretation is that, for the purposes\nof the AI Act, the legislator meant for these principles to be included\nwhenever the Act refers to fundamental rights. It is, besides, not\nuncommon for a legal term to have different meanings in different\nlegal settings.\nThus, it should not be dispositive that the explicit SIA contained\nin the EP position (see 5.2) was not included in the final version.\nRather, the provisions on risk assessment and mitigation form a cen-\nterpiece of the protective measures included in the AI Act. Without\nincluding environmental risks in the risk assessment and mitigation,\nin effect, not much consideration for environmental risks would\nremain and certainly not the \"high level of protection\" that Art. 1(1)\nmandates.\nAs a caveat, it should be noted that, while the AI Act requires\nclimate risk assessment and mitigation, no detailed reporting is\nmandated. For HRAI systems the documentation must comprise\na detailed description of the risk management system, but not the\nrisk assessment or its results (Annex IV(5)). Providers of GPAI mod-\nels with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice or European\nharmonized standards, both of which are not yet available, or alter-\nnative means of compliance for assessment by the Commission (Art.\n55(2)). If these will entail a detailed reporting of the risk assessment,\nand to whom, is yet to be determined.\n5.5 Discussion and Interim Conclusion on the\nAI Act\nOverall, while the AI Act introduces valuable steps toward address-\ning climate-related concerns in AI development and deployment,\nit falls short of establishing a comprehensive framework for mit-\nigating the environmental risks posed by AI systems. Key provi-\nsions on transparency and risk management for high-risk AI and\ngeneral-purpose AI systems make some progress in requiring doc-\numentation of computational resources and energy consumption,\nbut significant gaps remain. For example, the Act does not mandate\nthe disclosure of energy consumption during the inference phase,\na crucial omission given the long-term environmental impact of\nAI applications. Moreover, transparency measures are restricted to\nauthorities, limiting broader accountability and public scrutiny.\nAdditionally, while the Act imposes risk assessment and mitiga-\ntion obligations on providers of HRAI systems and GPAI models\nwith systemic risk, these provisions lack sufficient emphasis on\nenvironmental factors. Although environmental protection is in-\ncluded in the Act’s objectives, its practical integration into risk\nmanagement remains unclear and no detailed reporting on mitiga-\ntion efforts concerning environmental risks is currently required.\nWithout stronger enforcement and clearer guidance, particularly\non the inclusion of energy consumption and other environmen-\ntal impacts in risk assessments, the Act’s potential to address the\ngrowing climate-related risks of AI systems will remain limited.\n6 Operationalizing the Requirements\n6.1 Model Providers and their Access to\nInfrastructure\nLeading model providers leverage extensive supercomputer net-\nworks equipped with high-performance GPUs.

USA\nimpacted by energy consumption reporting. We assume that they\npossess privileged access or considerable influence over the utilized\ninfrastructure given their financial power or strategic value. One\ncan distinguish between companies that develop closed models (e.g.,\nOpenAI) and those that create open-source models (e.g., Meta).\nStartups and smaller companies are expected to either directly\ndeploy such models, use available API services of leading model\nproviders, or fine-tune existing models. Although these companies\ndo not typically train large models themselves, they must report\nenergy consumption for fine-tuning. Under our proposed inter-\npretation, however, only if the fine-tuning of a model leads to a\nsubstantial modification.\n6.2 Levels for Measuring and Estimating Energy\nConsumption\nThere are several levels within a data center based on which energy\nconsumption may be measured or estimated [4]. These include (1)\nthe data center level, (2) the cumulative server level, (3) the GPU-\nLevel and other hardware within a server and (4) various other\nlevels. In this section, we outline each level along with their bene-\nfits, drawbacks, and estimation methods for when measurement is\nunavailable.\n6.2.1 Data Center Level. On the data center level, the power re-\nquired to operate the entire data center is measured, including both\nthe direct power consumption of computing equipment and the\nadditional overhead for cooling and maintaining the data center.\nThis approach provides the most extensive and complete figures\nsince it represents the actual energy usage, but also assumes that a\ndata center is exclusively utilized for the pre-training by the model\nprovider. It encourages the selection of an efficient data center. Ad-\nditionally, data centers have average PUE values of 1.58, so this\noverhead makes up a significant portion of the energy consump-\ntion. On the other hand, the power usage resulting solely from the\nmodel’s architecture, the quantity of training data, the efficiency of\nthe implementation, and experimental settings is very important\nbut is somewhat skewed by the efficiency of the data center.\nIf data-center level power consumption measurement is not avail-\nable, using the PUE factor for estimation is deemed appropriate. To\ncalculate total energy usage, the PUE factor is multiplied by the raw\ncomputational power consumption measured or estimated at the cu-\nmulative server or rack level (see below). This might be reasonable,\nif only parts of a data center are utilized and only measurements\ncloser to the ICT equipment are available.\n6.2.2 Cumulative Server Level. A large-scale model is trained across\nmany servers in a distributed manner. Each server includes GPUs\nresponsible for the primary computation. To accurately monitor\nthe power consumption over time, a local power distribution unit\n(PDU), capable of measuring the provided power, is attached to each\nserver. Aggregating these measurements yields a highly precise\nfigure of the total energy consumption attributable to the model’s\ncomputations. Instead of aggregating local PDUs, the usage of pri-\nmary PDUs or uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems already\nmeasuring at the rack level or even many racks is also suitable\n(See also Appendix, Figure 1), as long as the measurements pre-\ncisely match fully the utilized hardware resources by the model\nproviders. The goal is to include all ICT-related power consumption\nbut exclude data center specific efficiency properties.\nThe upside of this method is its high accuracy, highly correlating\nwith model size and structure, data quantity, and hardware-aware\nsoftware implementation. It is widely recognized in the industry\nfor assessing power consumption in data centers. According to a\n2023 Green Grid industry survey [77], 66% of data centers can track\npower demand at least on rack-level. Roughly one third of over-\nall data centers are already able to collect average utilization and\npower demand data for individual servers and storage equipment\nand match this data to their IT equipment inventory. We assume\nthat the data centers that are used for training by large model\nproviders are already able to track this information given its high\ncost relevance. However, a significant number of data centers do not\ntrack power demand yet. The surveyed data center professionals\nestimate to require between 3-6 months (Europe: 15%, Global: 19%),\n1 year (Europe: 29%, Global: 28%), 2 years (Europe: 12%, Global:\n10%), 3 years (Europe: 4%, Global: 4%) or more than 4 years (Europe:\n11%, Global: 8%) to implement adequate power collection abilities.\nFor European data centers these numbers stand in (surprising) con-\ntrast to the obligation under the EED and Delegated Regulation to\nprovide energy consumption data by Sep 15, 2024 (Art. 3(1) and\nAnnex II(1)(e) Delegated Regulation). Either a substantial number\nof the participants was unaware of the obligations; or thereby ac-\nknowledged their inability to comply in time; or the question was\ntoo narrow, being pointed at individual servers, while the EED also\nallows measurement at the higher-level UPS.\nAn estimation is possible when GPU hours and the hardware\nused are known. By multiplying a GPU-hour with the peak utiliza-\ntion power consumption specified by the manufacturer, one can\nestimate the upper limit of energy consumption at the server level.\nThis upper bound is typically higher than the actual consumption,\nas GPU utilization rarely reaches its theoretical peak due to other\nresource constraints. Higher GPU efficiency means that the same\noperations are completed in less time, reducing the overhead from\nnon-utilization-dependent hardware power consumption.\n6.2.3 GPU-Level and other hardware within a server. The mea-\nsurement may be based on the energy usage of particular compo-\nnents as determined by on-chip sensors. Nvidia GPUs and certain\nCPUs already provide straightforward power consumption moni-\ntoring, therefore estimations are usually not necessary. However,\ndespite GPU power consumption being a significant factor and its\nusage correlating with the total power usage, it substantially under-\nrepresents the actual energy consumption since it measures just a\nsingle component. CPU power usage is a relatively minor factor in\nconsumption. Most other server components cannot be measured.\nWe advocate against using GPU-level or other component-based\npower consumption tracking for overall energy measurements.\n6.2.4 Other levels. Other measurement levels, such as Workload,\nCloud Instance, or Virtual Machine, involve high complexity and\nnumerous assumptions, resulting in a lack of standardized mea-\nsurement or estimation methods with considerable uncertainty. We\nadvise against using these levels for power consumption tracking.\n6.2.5 Interim Conclusion on the Level of Measurement.

This approach\ncaptures the total computation-related power usage and is better\nsuited to help providers optimize their AI models and algorithms for\nenergy efficiency. Additionally, the PUE factor of each data center,\nwhich is reported and published by the data center operator under\nthe Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) 2023/1791 and Delegated Reg-\nulation (EU) 2024/1364, provides a useful estimate of overall energy\nconsumption [4]. With these two figures, it is possible to distinguish\nbetween model-specific power usage (server-level computation)\nand the data center’s efficiency, offering a clearer picture of the\ntotal energy investment [4].

Major model\nproviders are likely to already measure power consumption as it\nis a primary cost factor and highly linked to computational power.\nDespite the availability of power consumption data, companies\nmay be tempted to use estimated values to protect sensitive infor-\nmation.

The access rights enshrined in Art.\n25(2) AI Act can help if the deploying entity becomes a provider—\nbut providers may invoke trade secrets and IP rights to dilute this\nobligation (Art. 25(5) AI Act). In our view, the interests of down-\nstream actors in reporting correct figures should generally trump\nthe secrecy interests of upstream providers, in this case. Under the\ncurrent setup, companies could always resort to computation-based\nestimations for their reporting. However, in order to gain the most\naccurate data, cloud platforms should be incentivized to provide\nenergy consumption data to their clients. Complementing Art. 25(2)\nAI Act, the obligation established in Sec. 15 of the German Energy\nEfficiency Act, requiring data centers to inform customers on their\nattributable annual energy consumption, could serve as a blueprint.\nNotably, such a law could also apply to cloud service providers\nbased outside the EU, with the caveat, however, that such an ex-\ntraterritorial application oftentimes lacks enforcement capabilities.\n6.4 Sustainability Impact Assessments\nThe operationalization of sustainability impact assessments (SIAs)\nwithin the risk assessments required under the AI Act involves\nintegrating environmental considerations into the existing risk\nmanagement frameworks that high-risk AI model providers and\nGPAI providers must follow. Much like data protection or algo-\nrithmic impact assessments, SIAs would serve as a practical tool\nfor embedding climate considerations into the development and\ndeployment of AI systems. Importantly, these assessments should\nnot be limited to high-risk AI models but should also apply to all AI\nsystems, regardless of the associated risk to health or safety. This\nis because the carbon footprint of AI models is often unrelated to\ntheir classification as high or low risk under the Act. Therefore, an\nSIA could ensure that environmental impacts are considered across\nthe entire AI landscape.\nThe SIA should involve evaluating various models and design\nchoices during the development process, comparing them not only\non their performance but also on their estimated environmental\nimpact. For instance, developers would need to assess whether a\nsimpler model, like linear regression or even a non-AI model, could\nachieve similar results with a smaller carbon footprint compared\nto more complex models like deep learning [33, 37]. Similarly, the\ndecision to use large, pre-trained models or training new, narrow\nmodels (almost) from scratch should factor in the potential climate\nbenefits. By using existing tools to measure the carbon impact of AI\nmodels, developers would be required to opt for the more environ-\nmentally sustainable option when performance is comparable. To\neffectively implement sustainability impact assessments, providers\nwould need to establish standardized methodologies for measuring\nthe environmental effects of AI models, particularly energy and\nwater usage during training and inference phases.\nTaking one step back, the concept of \"data protection by design\"\nshould be expanded to include “sustainability by design, ” under\nwhich developers should actively seek to reduce the contribution\nof ICT, including AI, to climate change [33].

address climate concerns through\nvarious reporting obligations, these measures largely lack consis-\ntency and clarity. We identify twelve policy recommendations that\nshould be integrated into the evaluation report due in August 2028\n(Article 111(6)), as well as any interpretive guidelines from the AI\nOffice and other agencies, and in reviews and potential textual\nrevisions prior to that date (see also [4]). These measures can be\ngrouped in four categories: Energy and Environmental Reporting\nObligations; Legal and Regulatory Clarifications; Transparency and\nAccountability Mechanisms; and Future Far-Reaching Measures\nbeyond Transparency.\n7.1 Energy and Environmental Reporting\nObligations\nThe current AI Act overlooks key environmental factors related to\nAI systems [56]. The following proposals aim to ensure comprehen-\nsive energy and environmental accountability for AI systems, both\nfor development and inference phases.\n• Inclusion of Energy Consumption From Inferences: We\npropose an interpretation that would at least bring energy\nconsumption for single inferences back into the scope (see\nalso [4]). Adoption of this interpretation by courts, author-\nities and industry, however, is uncertain. Therefore, both\nsingle and overall inferences should be included as a report-\ning category in Annex XI and Annex XII (vis-à-vis authorities\nand downstream providers) through delegated acts from the\nCommission (Articles 53(5) and (6)) and future recommenda-\ntions from the AI Office.\n• Indirect Emissions and Water Consumption Reporting:\nThe Act currently omits indirect emissions from AI applica-\ntions (e.g., those used for oil and gas exploration [37]) and\nwater consumption [49]. Reporting should include: Providers\nreporting water usage, and deployers reporting application-\nrelated emissions, allowing for estimates where precise mea-\nsurements are impossible, particularly when dealing with\nfuture scenarios.\n• Energy Reporting at the Cumulative Server Level : En-\nergy consumption should be reported at the cumulative\nserver level (see also [4]). In this endeavor, estimations may\nbe used only when direct measurements are unavailable.\nThese principles should guide the development of technical\nstandards under Article 40 of the AI Act, as well as the po-\ntential implementation of the Global Digital Compact on a\nglobal scale.\n7.2 Legal and Regulatory Clarifications on AI\nModels and Providers\nAmbiguities in the AI Act regarding provider responsibilities for\nAI models need to be clarified to ensure that entities know when\nand what to comply with. The following proposals seek ensure that\ncompanies understand their obligations, that open-source models\nare on par with closed models, and that the regulatory framework\nsets effective incentives at the source (data centers) to mitigate the\nenvironmental impact of AI model development and deployment.\n• Clarifying Provider Status for Model Modifications :\nThe current definition of provider status needs to focus on\nsubstantial modifications to AI models, specifically those that\ninvolve changing the model’s weights. Reporting obligations\nand the change-of-provider threshold should be tied to com-\nputational costs incurred during significant modifications,\nwith a minimum computational cost threshold ensuring that\nonly energy-intensive changes trigger additional reporting\n[4].\n• Elimination of the Open-Source Exemption : The open-\nsource exemption from reporting obligations should be re-\nmoved, as making parts of a model public does not justify ex-\nclusion from environmental accountability [4]. Open-source\nmodels can have significant energy implications and should\nadhere to the same reporting standards as proprietary mod-\nels.\n• Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Targets for\nData Centers: The EED and Delegated Regulation should\nbe amended in three regards, following the German Energy\nEfficiency Act: they should set binding efficiency targets\n(PUE) and renewable energy targets for data centers; and\ninclude an information obligation for data center operators\nand cloud service providers vis-à-vis their customers regard-\ning the attributable energy consumption. These measures\nshould be included in the 2025 evaluation report. This would\nboth increase transparency and facilitate more sustainable\ndecisions by market participants.\n7.3 Transparency and Accountability\nMechanisms\nTo promote public trust and accountability in AI’s environmental\nimpact, the following measures are recommended:\n• Public Access to Climate-Related Disclosures: All climate-\nrelated disclosures, including energy consumption, should\nbe made accessible to the general public [4]. If only aggregate\ndata are shared, trade secrets can be protected while allowing\nfor public scrutiny by analysts, academics, and NGOs. Pub-\nlic transparency would drive market pressure, reputational\nincentives, and public accountability; it would, arguably, en-\ncourage companies to reduce their environmental impact.\n• Energy Reporting for High-Risk AI (HRAI) : For High-\nRisk AI (HRAI) systems, the Act should require the disclosure\nof energy consumption rather than computational resources\nto eliminate inaccuracies and enhance comparability.\n• Environmental Risk Assessments: Providers should be\nrequired to include environmental risks in their risk assess-\nments. The language in Art. 1(1) and Recital 1, as well as Art.\n9 and 55 AI Act should be clarified to reflect this. This will\nensure that environmental impacts are systematically eval-\nuated alongside other risks during AI system development\nand deployment.\n7.4 Beyond Transparency\nIn addition to the existing

Hacker\nThe following proposals focus on reducing AI’s strain on energy\nresources and fostering more sustainable energy practices:\n• Restrictions on AI Training and Inference During Peak\nHours: One future measure could involve limiting AI train-\ning and certain inference tasks (e.g., those for recreation-\nrelated purposes) to non-peak energy demand hours [ 33].\nThis would reduce the strain on energy grids during peak\ntimes and make AI energy usage more manageable and sus-\ntainable.\n• Obligations for Data Centers and AI Companies to Cre-\nate Renewable Energy Sources : AI companies and data\ncenters should be required to create new renewable energy\nsources to offset any excess energy demand caused by their\noperations. This measure could help ensure that renewable\nenergy, which is a finite resource, is not monopolized by AI\nand data centers, leaving enough clean energy for the rest of\nthe industry. Clear definitions and guidelines would need to\nbe established to define which types of energy consumption\nwould be covered by this ’new source requirement’.\n• Tradable Energy Budgets for AI : Another possible long-\nterm measure could involve implementing tradable energy\nbudgets for AI, similar to the EU Emissions Trading Sys-\ntem (EU ETS) [ 33]. Companies that consume particularly\nlarge amounts of energy would have a capped energy budget\nfor AI operations and could trade these credits. This would\ncreate a market-based approach to managing and reducing\nAI-related energy consumption. It would, arguably, encour-\nage companies to optimize their energy usage and invest in\nenergy efficiency.\n8 Objections and Solutions\nImplementing the proposed policy recommendations presents both\npractical and political challenges, particularly given the EU’s broader\nregulatory landscape and the evolving international context. This\nsection outlines four key objections to our proposals and sketches\nsolutions. First, a central priority of the new European Commis-\nsion is the simplification of the digital acquis (‘fitness check’) [59].\nThere is concern that adding further reporting requirements and\nregulatory obligations could create administrative burdens that\ncounteract this goal. However, several of our proposals, particularly\nstandardized energy reporting metrics and clearer environmental\nrisk assessments, align with the EU’s push for regulatory clarity\nand streamlining. Rather than adding complexity, these measures\nwould, arguably, make compliance more predictable and feasible.\nSecond, the shifting international AI governance landscape cre-\nates uncertainty regarding the feasibility of ambitious environmen-\ntal rules. There is concern that EU regulatory efforts might face\nresistance from international AI providers or risk competitive dis-\nadvantages. While acknowledging a trend toward deregulation in\nsome corners of the world, we argue that this reinforces the need\nfor robust EU policy leadership. The AI Act’s extraterritorial scope\nalready compels global AI providers to comply with EU regula-\ntions when operating in the European market. By introducing clear,\nenforceable environmental obligations, the EU can set a global reg-\nulatory precedent, and shape international norms despite external\npressures. Moreover, some of our proposals - such as market-based\nmechanisms for energy efficiency - offer flexible compliance path-\nways that may be more politically acceptable in a deregulatory\nglobal environment.\nThird, the AI industry, particularly large-scale AI providers and\ndata center operators, may resist additional regulatory obligations,\nciting economic and technological constraints. There is also concern\nthat lack of enforcement mechanisms could render some obligations\nineffective. Hence, our proposals emphasize practical enforcement\nstrategies, including gradual implementation, industry incentives,\nand transparency-driven accountability. For example: public access\nto climate-related disclosures can create reputational incentives\nfor compliance, even in the absence of strict enforcement; energy\nefficiency targets for data centers can be phased in over time for a\nrealistic transition without abrupt regulatory shocks; clarifications\non provider status and reporting obligations offer legal certainty to\ncompanies. Fourth, some of our more ambitious proposals - such as\ntradable energy budgets for AI or restrictions on AI training during\npeak hours - may be viewed as far-reaching or difficult to implement\nin the near term. While we recognize that not all proposals will\nbe immediately adopted, it is crucial to articulate ambitious policy\noptions at this juncture. The AI regulatory landscape is evolving,\nand incremental steps toward long-term measures can be integrated\ninto future evaluation rounds of the AI Act, the EED, and related\nframeworks. As with the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), ini-\ntial skepticism toward market-based environmental regulations can\ngive way to gradual acceptance as regulatory mechanisms mature.\nGiven the current political momentum and upcoming AI Act eval-\nuation rounds, there is a narrow but critical window to influence\nenvironmental AI governance. While not all recommendations will\nbe immediately adopted, presenting a structured, well-argued pol-\nicy package ensures that sustainability concerns remain central to\nAI regulation in the EU and beyond - rather than being sidelined in\nthe face of deregulation.\n9 Conclusion\nAI systems, many of them containing energy-intensive generative\nAI components, are increasingly integrated into economic and soci-\netal processes. Importantly, as AI intersects with robotics, writing\ncode and steering devices, it is poised to merge decisively into\nindustrial processes, proliferating its deployment, but also its cli-\nmate effects. Currently, this intersection between the AI and the\ngreen transition sits at a regulatory blind spot, inadequately ad-\ndressed in current regulation. In this paper, we take a closer look at\nsustainability-related data center regulation and the sustainability\nprovisions in the AI Act. While they present a good first step, they\ntoo often lack ambition, clarity and consistency, or present signifi-\ncant challenges in implementation.
