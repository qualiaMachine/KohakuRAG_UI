At the personal level, every US household has an\naverage of 25 connected devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, wireless headphones, smart\nTVs, smart speakers, ﬁtness trackers, and connected ﬁtness machines [Deloitte, 2021]. Digital technologies have also\nimpacted major aspects of services that we regularly use and rely upon. Amazon warehouses are equipped with over\n200,000 robots in 2020 to boost operational efﬁciency [Ackerman, 2021]. AI-powered robots are a growing presence in\nthe farming industry [Sheikh, 2020]. Medicine has been transformed by technological advances leading to the decoding\nof the humane genome, resulting in genetically targeted therapies that help cancer patients survive longer or even enter\nfull remission [Hum, 2021]. Looking ahead, AI is showing great promise in solving the grand challenge in biology –\nthe protein structure prediction problem – which can once again lead to revolutionary changes in the ﬁeld of biological\nsciences [Jumper et al., 2021].\nTechnology has also aided under-privileged and vulnerable groups in surprising ways. As an example, cell phones\nempower women in vulnerable situations to stay connected with the world, receive education and news, and establish\nbusinesses to support their families [Pathak, 2021]. Emerging technologies such as surveillance cameras enable\nauthorities to respond to violence and curb crimes. Drones deliver life-saving medical supplies in rescues [Nyaaba and\narXiv:2108.06738v1  [cs.CY]  15 Aug 2021\n\nSocio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward A PREPRINT\nAyamga, 2021] and robots are employed in ﬁeld discovery where the environment is unsafe for humans [Arnold et al.,\n2018]. The most recent example is the pandemic where digital technologies empowered society to stay connected and\nfunction effectively, and aided in disease tracking and drug discovery to limit the spread of the pandemic [Budd et al.,\n2020, Salathé et al., 2020, Facebook AI, 2020].\nAdvancements in digital technologies have a bootstrapping effect. The past ﬁfty years of technological innovations from\nthe computer architecture community have brought innovations and orders-of-magnitude efﬁciency improvements that\nengender use cases that were not previously possible – stimulating novel application domains and increasing uses and\ndeployments at an ever-faster pace. Consequently, computing technologies have fueled signiﬁcant economic growth,\ncreating education opportunities, enabling access to a wider and more diverse spectrum of information, and connecting\npeople of differing needs in the world together.\nMicroprocessors at 50\nDigital technologies have witnessed signiﬁcant advancement over the past ﬁve decades. The ﬁrst commercially-produced\nmicroprocessor – Intel 4004 – was manufactured in 10,000 nm process technology in 1971, and ran at 740kHZ with\n2,250 transistors [Intel]. Fifty years later, the typical microprocessor is manufactured in a 5+ nm process technology and\nis capable of running at 5,000,000kHz (e.g., [Intel, 2019, AMD, 2020]) with more than 3.9 billion transistors. This is a\nmore than 6,750 fold improvement in processor clock speed and 1.7 million times more transistors for microprocessors\nmanufactured in 1971 than that in 2021.\nMoore’s law scaling underpins the evolution of microprocessors [Moore, 1965]. The steady doubling of transistor\ndensity enables miniaturization of computing systems, from large mainframes to personal computers and from mo-\nbile/smartphones to Internet of Things (IoTs) and AR/VR wearables. The 1990s were the golden age of microprocessor\ninnovations. Microarchitectural optimizations enabled impressive ILP scaling: most notably, in-order vs. out-of-order\nexecution [Tomasulo, 1967, Smith, 1982a, Hwu and Patt, 1986], branch predictors [Smith, 1981, Lee and Smith, 1984,\nPnevmatikatos et al., 1993, Yeh et al., 1993, Jimenez and Lin, 2001], caches [Smith, 1982b, Hill, 1988, Przybylski\net al., 1989, Jouppi, 1990], prefetchers [Baer and Chen, 1991, Fu et al., 1992, Falsaﬁ and Wenisch, 2014], single vs.\nsimultaneous multithreading [Tullsen et al., 1995, 1996, Nemirovsky and Tullsen, 2013].\nFigure 1: PUE of hyperscalar datacenters, such as\nGoogle’s, has improved from 1.21 (2008) to 1.10\n(2021) [Google, a] whereas the PUE of Facebook\ndatacenters is 1.10 (2020) [Facebook] and the av-\nerage PUE for a typical data center in 2020 is\n1.58 [Lawrence, 2019, 2020].\nIn the 2000s, microprocessors faced two signiﬁcant challenges:\nthe memory wall [Wulf and McKee, 1996] and the power\nwall [Dennard et al., 1974, Bohr, 2007]. While processor\nfrequencies improved with Moore’s law scaling, memory la-\ntency did not and memory subsystems increasingly gated per-\nformance. Furthermore, Dennard scaling came to an end and\nﬁne-grained, high power density thermal hot spots limited the\nperformance of microprocessors. The Memory and Power walls\nsubsequently drove decades of innovations in multi-core scal-\ning [Olukotun et al., 2007], memory consistency and cache co-\nherence [Adve and Gharachorloo, 1996, Hill, 1998, Sorin et al.,\n2011], cache and memory hierarchy optimization [Qureshi et al.,\n2007, Jaleel et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2011, Balasubramonian et al.,\n2011, Sardashti et al., 2015, Balasubramonian, 2019, Jain and\nLin, 2019], network-on-chip design and optimization [Dally\nand Towles, 2001, Wang et al., 2002, Enright and Peh, 2009,\nJerger et al., 2017], and power- and thermal-aware design and\nmanagement [Brooks et al., 2000, Brooks and Martonosi, 2001,\nSkadron et al., 2003, Kaxiras and Martonosi, 2008, Själander\net al., 2014].\nDuring the same period, computations were migrating from\nclient/personal devices to the cloud, demanding signiﬁcant in-\nvestment in large-scale data centers [Barroso and Hölzle, 2009]. The location of these data centers is dictated by\na myriad of constraints – maximizing power and operational efﬁciency, proximity to population centers, weather\nconditions, local tax breaks – leading to some interesting tradeoffs in size, location, and ownership (on premise or\ncloud based) of the data centers. In 2019, urban data centers that optimize for service latency responsiveness are\n26.7% smaller in size than the average data center operated by the major cloud providers [Greenstein and Fang, 2020].\nFurthermore, between traditional and highly optimized hyperscale data centers, power usage effectiveness (PUE) has a\nstark difference – more than 40% higher efﬁciency for hyperscale data centers (Figure 1). Going forward, the demand\n2\n\n[Image page=2 idx=1 name=Im1.png] Size: 1302x948, Data: 127740 bytes\n\nSocio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward A PREPRINT\non fast(er) service response and availability is playing an increasingly signiﬁcant role on data center site selection and\ncomputing infrastructures connecting the edge and the cloud.\nThe 2010s is the golden age of domain-speciﬁc architectures and specialized hardware, fueled by the rise of big data\nand AI [Esmaeilzadeh et al., 2011, Jouppi et al., 2018]. The massive economic growth opportunities of AI have\nrevolutionized the entire system stack design, resulting in hardware tailored to machine learning execution [Ovtcharov\net al., 2015, Chen et al., 2016, Jouppi et al., 2017, Fowers et al., 2018, Shao et al., 2019, Mattson et al., 2020, Henry et al.,\n2020, Reddi et al., 2021, Anderson et al., 2021, Jang et al., 2021, Thompto et al., 2021, NVIDIA]from megawatt data\ncenter-scale infrastructures, to tens of watts inference engines, to micro-watt microcontrollers at the edge. Building on\ntop of domain-speciﬁc characteristics, further system efﬁciency can be extracted with a rich array of application-speciﬁc\naccelerators at the cloud scale [Taylor et al., 2020, Ranganathan et al., 2021].\nThe last ﬁfty years of digital products have been driven by a combination of market innovation and user needs. In\nsome cases, scientiﬁc curiosity, coupled with a market need for specialty medical drugs drove innovations such as the\npursuit of the human genome. In other cases, innovations created a market such as the case for smartphones. The\navailability of smartphones led to further innovations and massive disruptions viasharing economy companies such\nas Uber and AirBnB [Hamari et al., 2016]. None of this would have been feasible without fundamental innovation in\nprocess technology, hardware and software design, and a laser focus on efﬁciency (Figure 1), optimization (Figure 2),\nand cost reduction. Altogether, digital technology advancement has led to efﬁciencies of scale propelling decades of\neconomic growth.\nFigure 2: As a result of Moore’s law scaling and architec-\ntural optimization, GPU theoretical performance (GFLOPs)\nper watt doubles every 3-4 years [Sun et al., 2019].\nThe narrow focus on marketability, efﬁciency, and disrup-\ntive innovation has also resulted in many challenging, and\nsometimes unexpected, societal issues. Examples include\nwidening disparity and inequity of access to digital tech-\nnologies, spread of disinformation and misinformation in\nonline platforms, privacy and security violations at both\nthe personal and political level, and propagation of human\nbias into AI training and use cases at-scale [Simons and\nJones, 2012, Abelson et al., 2015, Gervais et al., 2016,\nAhmed et al., 2017, Whittaker et al., 2018, Speicher et al.,\n2018, Chouldechova et al., 2018, Ekstrand et al., 2018,\nSelbst et al., 2019, Ali et al., 2019, Babaei et al., 2019,\nCrawford et al., 2019, Papakyriakopoulos et al., 2020,\nPark et al., 2021, Bender et al., 2021, Kleinberg and\nRaghavan, 2021]. In addition, the information and com-\nputing technology sectors consume a signiﬁcant amount\nof global electricity, water, and natural resources, leading\nto paramount carbon and environmental footprint [Jain\nand Wullert, 2002, Strubell et al., 2019, Manne, 2020,\nWu and Gupta, 2021, Gupta et al., 2021, Crawford et al.,\n2021]. Digital technology is an integral part of human existence. As the ﬁeld matures and as the world faces dire\nchallenges from climate change to societal and political upheavals, a deliberate approach is required to technological\ninnovation that centers on a positive societal impact while serving the needs of a market economy.\nLooking to the Future\nPredicting the future is always difﬁcult. How many of us could have predicted that the technology depicted in futuristic\nTV shows from ﬁve decades ago such as Star Trek would be commonplace today (cell phones, AI, voice recognition to\nname a few)? However, what is possible to foretell are the following:\n• Pervasive Connectivity: the internet and the technology enabling it will become even more fundamental to\neveryday life, requiring that information and communication technology infrastructure, just like power grids,\nbe both secure and resilient;\n• Sustainability: Environmental pollution, resource depletion and climate change will dominate how products\nare designed, produced, consumed, and recycled. Systems must be manufactured with less planetary impact,\nuse less energy while in operation, and produce less e-waste at the end of life; and\n• Demographic Inclusion: Massive demographic upheavals resulting in an aging population in most of the\nworld and rising population centers in Sub-Saharan Africa will inﬂuence what products are created and for\nwhom, and where technology is designed and deployed in the future.\n3\n\n[Image page=3 idx=1 name=Im2.png] Size: 874x698, Data: 214814 bytes\n\nSocio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward A PREPRINT\nPervasive Connectivity. In 2021, approximately 65% of the world’s population has access to the internet [Lin,\n2021], and this is expected to improve moving forward. Seamless connectivity will be required for everyday activities\nfrom ordering groceries to driving your car. There are advantages to connectivity from more efﬁcient driving and less\nfood waste, easy access to educational resources, and the ability to work remotely. However, what this also implies is\nthat our lives and livelihoods will be inexorably linked to the accessibility, privacy, security, and resilience of the IT\ninfrastructure.\nReliable internet access for the world’s population is an essential requirement of pervasive connectivity. Despite\nthe positive societal and economical impact, at-scale power delivery and networking infrastructure development has\nproven to be costly and highly geographically-constrained. According to an analysis from the FCC, at least 18 million\nAmericans did not have stable broadband in 2020 [Wheeler, 2020], and many who have access may not be able to\nafford it. According to a recent UN report, two-thirds of school age children do not have access to the internet in their\nhome [unicef, 2020]. Diverse technology innovations are particularly needed to increase information accessibility\nand to connect people of differing needs in the world together in a resilient manner. Microsoft Airband [Microsoft,\na] aims to expand broadband access in rural parts of the United States while Google Loon [Loon] and Facebook\nAquila [Wikipedia] provide affordable high-speed internet to under-connected communities by overcoming physical\nbarriers with innovative technology solutions. The recent success of placing internet communication satellites in low\nEarth orbit opens the door to tremendous opportunities for providing internet access to populations in challenging\ngeographic locations [Starlink]. While satellite communication removes the geographical and political boundaries, it\ncan accelerate the spread of (mis)information. Thus, as technologies continue to enable pervasive connectivity at scale,\nwe must take a deliberate approach to develop technology solutions responsibly.\nAlong with pervasive connectivity comes the requirements for security and privacy given the prevalence of ransomware\nattacks and ongoing privacy hacks from both private groups and nation states. Many aspects of our public and private\nlives will be online and accessible to bad actors, and the internet and the technology it enables will continue to be\nsusceptible without strong security and privacy measures in place from the top of the software stack to the underlying\nhardware running the code [Lipp et al., 2018, Kocher et al., 2019].\nThe IT infrastructure, just like in other critical infrastructure such as telecommunication and power delivery, will require\nbackup and recovery mechanisms in order to minimize or eliminate downtime. These already exist in cloud data centers\nwith examples such as redundant storage [Microsoft, 2021a] and network [Microsoft, 2021b], and backup batteries and\ngenerators. However, redundancy can require signiﬁcant additional hardware and network bandwidth which inﬂates the\ncost of the overall cloud infrastructure.\nRecent climate events are pushing the issue of resiliency to the forefront. In the Texas power outages of 2021, many\ntop-tier data centers were able to continue operations using diesel backup generators. However, there is a limit to how\nlong backup systems can operate given the ﬁnite amount of fuel onsite and weather conditions making it difﬁcult to\ntransport more fuel to the data center [Sverdlik, 2021]. As catastrophic weather events become more common and\nlast longer due to climate change, even the largest data centers may have trouble [Department of Energy, 2019]. For\ninstance, the latest ﬁres in Oregon brought down major power grid infrastructure that connects the grids of California to\nOregon at the same time as a heat wave resulted in a need for additional power for cooling [Roth, 2021]. California\nnarrowly escaped rolling blackouts this time, but these events will continue to increase in intensity and frequency as hot\nand dry conditions lengthen and strengthen the ﬁre season, reduce hydro-electric power due to a lack of water, and\nincrease the need for power for human comfort and survival.\nFor IT infrastructures of the future, a one-size-ﬁts-all solution may not work either for the type of data center or for the\nservices that it provides. Large data centers that require many megawatts to operate may not be viable during a blackout\nwith limited power and where critical operations such as hospitals are given priority. Smaller data centers may be more\nresilient either with backup generators or using a local micro-grid to run operations when the main grid is down. On\nthe service side, some applications may be more tolerant of outages than others. Hence, with a limited power budget,\napplication availability should be tiered during critical times. Other solutions include making applications resilient by\ndesign or more amenable to migration to a non-impacted data center given enough warning before catastrophic events\noccur [Hornsby, 2018, Google Cloud Architecture Center].\nDesigning for resilience addresses issues that are not just related to resilience under climate duress but also solutions that\nare tolerant of different geographies, power and networking infrastructures. In order to achieve pervasive connectivity\nacross the world, IT infrastructure must be available across developed and developing regions. In Africa, for example, it\nis difﬁcult and expensive to develop a power grid that can serve such a large continent. Renewables, however, have\nthe beneﬁt of being portable and scalable, and are powering much of Africa’s latest power advances, with off-grid and\nmicro-grid renewable energy solutions serving poorer and/or non-centralized communities [The World Bank, 2020].\nData centers serving these regions may also have to rely on micro-grids running on renewable energy that ﬂuctuate\nin their capacity based on the weather. Hence, rather than designing for a resilient and consistent power grid, IT\n4\n\nSocio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward A PREPRINT\ninfrastructure may be better served by (co-)designing agile applications and data centers, such as [Íñigo Goiri et al.,\n2015, Radovanovic et al., 2021, Lin et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021], that implicitly assume power ﬂuctuations and\nvariability.\nAchieving pervasive connectivity in the presence of resiliency, security, and privacy requirements can be challenging\ngiven the interrelated nature of the problems. For instance, current approaches to achieving resilient computing often\nrely on replication and redundancy which not only increases cost but also enlarges the surface of security and privacy\npreservation. Migrating applications to another region, which may be necessary due to power constraints, can expose\ndata to further security threats. To retain physical security of data, applications may be hosted in limited geographical\nregions but this can increase application vulnerability to catastrophic events. In addition, secure and resilient computing\ninfrastructures can often come with signiﬁcant environmental implications. Hence, any computing infrastructure\nsolutions must be cognizant of the multifaceted nature of the problems being addressed.\nSustainability. Resource limitations, climate change, water depletion, electronic waste, ecosystem damage, and\nenvironmental racism are just a few of the topics under the larger sustainability umbrella. There is increased focus on\nthese topics from both industrial and political institutions. All major technology companies have pledged to reduce or\neliminate their carbon footprint in the next decade by reducing the environmental impact associated with manufacturing\nand using their products. Examples of such commitments are Facebook achieving NetZero in operational emissions\nin 2020 and across its value chain by 2030 [Facebook], Apple’s pledge for 100% carbon neutral supply chain by\n2030 [Apple], Microsoft’s goal of being carbon negative by 2030 [Smith], and Google’s aim of 24x7 carbon free data\ncenters [Google, b]. In 2020, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft were the top four technology companies\nthat purchased signiﬁcant renewable energy capacities, accounting for 30% of the cumulative total from corporations\nglobally [Schechner, 2021]. In addition, countries and trading zones are legislating carbon emission requirements.\nChina has committed to be carbon free by 2060 [Myers, 2020] and the EU has committed to cut carbon emissions by\n55% by 2030 [BBC, 2021].\nSustainability targets and the associated regulations will continue to increase, and hardware must be manufactured with\nless planetary impact, use less energy while in operation, and produce less e-waste at the end of life [Orcuttarchive, 2015,\nChang et al., 2017]. Existing practices such as the move to hyperscale data centers have already reduced IT’s carbon\nfootprint by consolidating and sharing computing resources, and operating those resources more efﬁciently (Figure 1)\n– AWS [Amazon, 2019], Azure [Microsoft, 2020], Google cloud [Evans and Gao, 2016], and Facebook datacenter\ninfrastructures [Lee and Rowe, 2020]. In fact, data center electricity consumption has slowed down signiﬁcantly. The\ntotal energy consumption of the US data centers increased by about 4% from 2010-2014, compared with the estimated\n24% increase from 2005-10 and nearly 90% increase from 2000-05 [Masanet et al., 2020]. Furthermore, despite the\nincrease in the global data center energy use, the number of users beneﬁting from the cloud infrastructure have increased\neven more—from 2010-18, the global data center compute instances increased by 5.5 times with an estimated 6%\nincrease in the global data center energy use.\nHowever, more can be done –we must go beyond efﬁciency optimization and build a sustainable ecosystem to achieve\nenvironmentally-sustainable computing. For instance, develop expandable hardware and software stack that facilitate\nsigniﬁcantly longer lifetimes than the current averages of less than 3 years for cell phones [Cordella et al., 2020] and 4\nto 5 years for servers [Ascierto and Lawrence, 2020]. Modular system design will enable component-level upgrades\nwithout having to decommission the system at its entirety, reducing overall electronic waste and the environmental\nfootprint [Fairphone]. Other actions being discussed or implemented require manufacturers to make their systems more\nrepairable, resulting in increased product lifetime [Wiens and Gordon-Byrne, 2017, Alsever, 2021]. Another option is\nto reduce the number of devices in an average household. In the US, for example, the average household is equipped\nwith an average of 25 connected devices [Deloitte, 2021]. In many cases, smartphones might be powerful enough for\nthe task, but a tablet or laptop is needed for a viable keyboard or a larger viewing platform. Some of these additional\ndevices could be replaced with a virtual reality or augmented reality solution that is both portable and can provide\nvirtual keyboards and visual clarity without requiring additional hardware. To achieve an environmentally sustainable\ncomputing future, we will have to build a circular economy for computing that supports the design principle of reduce,\nreuse, repair, and recycle. These and other potential solutions likely require a complete redesign of the software and\nhardware stacks both at the edge, within the cloud, and in the edge-cloud collaborative execution environment, in order\nto provide resilient, long lasting, innovative solutions.\nMaking technology more sustainable is only one part of the technical challenge. There is another side to the story—there\nare signiﬁcant sustainability beneﬁts resulting from computing technology. Programs, such as Farm Beats [Microsoft,\n2015], address how to optimize operations on a farm using technology that is inexpensive and readily available to\npeople in rural areas. Food production accounts for 19% of the world’s carbon emissions, and producing food more\nefﬁciently and with less toxicity has long term beneﬁts for the world [Gates, 2021]. For the residential sector in the\nUS, space heating and cooling contributed to over 40% of the total electricity consumption [U.S. Energy Information\n5\n\nSocio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward A PREPRINT\nAdminstration]. This is where smart home IoT devices, such as Nest, can have an impact. AI is used to discover new\nelectrocatalysts for more efﬁcient and scalable ways to store and use renewable energy [Zitnick et al., 2020] while also\nbeing used to predict renewable energy availability ahead of actual generation to better utilize the energy [Elkin and\nWitherspoon]. Another example is the current Covid outbreak. As horrendous as the outbreak has been and continues\nto be, technology has enabled a portion of the economy to continue to operate even as employees work remotely. In\naddition, the global carbon emissions for 2020 dropped by 6.4% with vehicle transportation in the US accounting for a\nportion of the global reduction [Tollefson, 2021]. Looking forward, information technology can improve efﬁciencies\nin practically every sector, from manufacturing to food production to transportation to controlling the climate in our\nhomes and ofﬁces. Although there is a carbon cost associated with manufacturing and operating the IT ecosystem, this\ncost must be evaluated holistically [Chang et al., 2010, Bardon et al., 2020, Gupta et al., 2021, Patterson et al., 2021] in\nlight of the beneﬁts such an ecosystem can provide in other domains [Hager et al., 2019, Tomasev et al., 2020, Mulhern,\n2021, United Nation, 2021].\nDemographic Inclusion. Recent data has pointed to signiﬁcant demographic changes that will be occurring by the\nyear 2100 [V ollset et al., 2020]. These include a radically declining and/or aging population in Europe, North America\nand Asia, and an increasing population of younger workers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Figure 3 shows one population\nprojection using data from the United Nations [Roser, 2019], indicating ﬂattening or decreasing populations in most\nof the world except for Africa. The population decline is strongly correlated with an improved quality of life and\neducational achievement of women – much of which is being facilitated by technologically engendered developments\nsuch as portable devices and the internet – along with access to reproductive services. This trend holds regardless of\nthe country, culture, or religion. These demographic changes will have a seismic impact on all societies, and will also\ndominate what and where technology is designed and deployed, respectively, in the future.\nFor technology to be truly inclusive in a fully-connected world, it must be available and usable foreveryone – regardless\nof physical capabilities, geographic restrictions, or economic constraints. With the projected demographic changes,\nassistive technologies to address the needs of an aging population with physical restrictions will be essential for\nenhancing an individual’s ability to be a viable and contributing member of society.\nFigure 3: Population growth estimation based on United\nNations medium growth projections [Roser, 2019].\nThere is a rich history of intersection between assistive\ntechnology and everyday products. Word prediction was\nused as an assistive technology aid for individuals with\nphysical or developmental difﬁculties before becoming\nmore mainstream [Jacobs, 2015]. Close captioning helps\nthe hearing impaired, but it is also used by people with\naverage hearing to capture the conversation in a noisy\nenvironment or to help with accents in the dialogue. The\nreverse is also true – some of the most innovative tech-\nnologies in the last few years are also inclusive of people\nwith physical limitations. Smart speakers, such as Siri\nor Alexa, enable people with limited sight or physical\nmobility to communicate via verbal commands. Indi-\nviduals with hearing issues can use their Apple AirPods\nas basic hearing aids [Haselton, 2019], and people with\naverage hearing can use AI-enabled voice assistants to\neliminate background noise and focus on the conversation\nat hand [Nachmani et al., 2020]. For the sight impaired,\nvirtual reality glasses are improving the eyesight of pa-\ntients with degenerative eye disease [Fearn, 2020].\nThe virtual ofﬁce technology and work culture developed during the Covid pandemic will continue to beneﬁt individuals\nwith physical limitations who may be unable to travel to work. Similarly, with the largest population of young\nworkers residing in Africa over the next decades, innovative virtual ofﬁce technology that can create seamless cohesion\nacross geographies and cultures will be critical to economic success. Looking to the future, there is a clear demand\nfor high-quality virtual reality experience in the ﬁrst-person perspective. However, realizing smooth virtual space\nexperience requires disruptive technology innovations – hardware architectures beyond V on Neumann, high pixel\ndensity displays [Ghosh et al., 2016, Kubota, 2020], near/in-sensor computing [Kodukula et al., 2021], ﬂexible\nelectronics [MacKenzie and Ho, 2015], or even brain-computer interface solutions [Brunner et al., 2011, Karageorgos\net al., 2020].\nAnother requirement of inclusive technology, especially in light of projected demographic changes, is that it must operate\nacross different geographic boundaries. In 2021, much of modern technology assumes some degree of development\n6\n\n[Image page=6 idx=1 name=Im3.png] Size: 3400x2400, Data: 360104 bytes\n\nSocio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward A PREPRINT\nand infrastructure, whether it be availability of the latest computing systems, broadband access, cell towers or power\nsources. However, much of the current world, including parts of developed countries, do not currently have unfettered\naccess to these facilities. Even more daunting, approximately 770 million people, or about 1 out of 10 people in the\nworld, do not have access to a stable supply of electricity [International Energy Agency].\nIn order to meet the upcoming needs of the world, technological growth and resources must focus on under-served\nareas. This includes developing data centers for regions that may not have a resilient power infrastructure or an\ninfrastructure that is based on local renewable energy sources and does not tap into a regional grid. IT devices must be\noperable under adverse conditions where the local network and/or power may not be available 24/7 or varies based on\nexternal conditions [Isaacman and Martonosi, 2011, Hester et al., 2013, Lucia et al., 2017, Saleem et al., 2020]. For\ninstance, devices need to operate for days without a recharge or must operate locally until wireless or broadband is\navailable [Yetim and Martonosi, 2015] to ensure delay tolerance while maintaining user experiences. Energy storage\ntechnology plays a crucial role to smooth the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation but the cost must be\nsigniﬁcantly improved for practical deployment [Plumer, 2021]. And, for technology to be truly inclusive, the way AI\ntechnologies are developed and used must be human-centered, driven by the cultural and demographic differences in\nthe population and with pro-social goals [Stray, 2021]. Furthermore, given its increasingly large impact on the society,\nAI must be developed with deliberation to construct fairer and more inclusive decisions and, at the same time, it must\nbe adopted responsibly [Askell et al., 2019, NIST, 2021]. AI-powered products must be transparent with users on how\ndata is gathered, used, and stored, and with controls to disable it [IBM, Microsoft, b, Google, c, Facebook, DOD].\nFinally, any IT technology must be economically-accessible to most of the world’s population. Unfortunately, even the\nmost basic form of computing devices, a cell phone, is prohibitively expensive for much of the world. According to the\nAlliance for Affordable Internet, nearly 2.5 billion people live in countries where a basic cell phone would cost nearly a\nquarter or more of the average monthly income [Roser, 2020]. Making the internet available to everyone will not solve\nthe problem if the devices commonly used to access the internet are a luxury item for the world’s poor [Naseem et al.,\n2020]. In addition, many of the devices currently being used are inexpensive basic phones. Hence, solutions must be\ndesigned for “dumb” phones in order to reach the poorest communities. Even if users eventually have smartphones, data\nrates and lack of free wiﬁ will limit the utility of data-heavy applications. Without reasonable device and application\navailability for the poorest communities, reaching the goal of pervasive connectivity will be difﬁcult if not impossible\nand the digital divide will continue to widen between the rich and the poor. And, all technological solutions come with\nenvironmental impact that will inadvertently impact the marginalized communities the most. Thus, when developing\ntechnological solutions, we must keep in mind why products are created and for whom, and where technology is\ndesigned and deployed, such that we consciously build environmentally-sustainable, socially-responsible, inclusive\ntechnologies for the next decades to come.\nConclusion\nPredicting the innovations of the future is a difﬁcult if not impossible task. However, the political, societal, and\nenvironmental challenges the world faces are clear, and technology can play a signiﬁcant role in helping societies adapt\nand thrive. The problems and solutions in the three domains of pervasive connectivity, sustainability, and inclusion\nare interconnected and must be addressed holistically. For instance, adapting the IT infrastructure to climate change\nmust not in turn make climate change worse. Making innovative devices and software to address the needs of an\naging population does not mean that poorer populations in other regions can be ignored. And population decline does\nnot fully address sustainability concerns – as standard of living improves with the help of technology, the per-capita\nenvironmental footprint of the population also increases [O’Neill et al., 2018]. Technology must be offered that is\ninclusive of the world’s physical, cultural, and economic diversity, and which is manufactured, used, and recycled with\nenvironmental sustainability at the forefront. We hope to inspire our architecture community to take broader and more\nholistic approaches when developing technologies which include a deeper understanding of the biological, societal,\ncultural, environmental, political, and economic implications of future technological innovations. To summarize:\n• Build resilient, secure infrastructures – software, hardware, and everything in-between – for the computing\nspectrum of systems at all sizes and scales.\n• Design for the entire system life cycle from manufacturing to end-of-life and for the entire software develop-\nment cycle from experimentation to deployment. Build environmentally-sustainable systems, software, and\nalgorithms – beyond energy efﬁciency.\n• Broaden the scope of technologies to serve people from different parts of the world and with differing needs\nby enabling equitable access to technology and the rich economic opportunities it presents.\n7\n\nSocio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths Forward A PREPRINT\nFor the next decades to come, we envision signiﬁcant cross-disciplinary efforts to build a circular development cycle by\nplacing pervasive connectivity, sustainability, and demographic inclusion at the design forefront in order to sustain and\nexpand the beneﬁts of a technologically rich society.\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank Doug Carmean, David Brooks, and Lizy John for their insightful feedback on this work.\nReferences\nDeloitte.

The ﬁrst commercially-produced\nmicroprocessor – Intel 4004 – was manufactured in 10,000 nm process technology in 1971, and ran at 740kHZ with\n2,250 transistors [Intel]. Fifty years later, the typical microprocessor is manufactured in a 5+ nm process technology and\nis capable of running at 5,000,000kHz (e.g., [Intel, 2019, AMD, 2020]) with more than 3.9 billion transistors. This is a\nmore than 6,750 fold improvement in processor clock speed and 1.7 million times more transistors for microprocessors\nmanufactured in 1971 than that in 2021.\nMoore’s law scaling underpins the evolution of microprocessors [Moore, 1965]. The steady doubling of transistor\ndensity enables miniaturization of computing systems, from large mainframes to personal computers and from mo-\nbile/smartphones to Internet of Things (IoTs) and AR/VR wearables. The 1990s were the golden age of microprocessor\ninnovations. Microarchitectural optimizations enabled impressive ILP scaling: most notably, in-order vs. out-of-order\nexecution [Tomasulo, 1967, Smith, 1982a, Hwu and Patt, 1986], branch predictors [Smith, 1981, Lee and Smith, 1984,\nPnevmatikatos et al., 1993, Yeh et al., 1993, Jimenez and Lin, 2001], caches [Smith, 1982b, Hill, 1988, Przybylski\net al., 1989, Jouppi, 1990], prefetchers [Baer and Chen, 1991, Fu et al., 1992, Falsaﬁ and Wenisch, 2014], single vs.\nsimultaneous multithreading [Tullsen et al., 1995, 1996, Nemirovsky and Tullsen, 2013].\nFigure 1: PUE of hyperscalar datacenters, such as\nGoogle’s, has improved from 1.21 (2008) to 1.10\n(2021) [Google, a] whereas the PUE of Facebook\ndatacenters is 1.10 (2020) [Facebook] and the av-\nerage PUE for a typical data center in 2020 is\n1.58 [Lawrence, 2019, 2020].\nIn the 2000s, microprocessors faced two signiﬁcant challenges:\nthe memory wall [Wulf and McKee, 1996] and the power\nwall [Dennard et al., 1974, Bohr, 2007]. While processor\nfrequencies improved with Moore’s law scaling, memory la-\ntency did not and memory subsystems increasingly gated per-\nformance. Furthermore, Dennard scaling came to an end and\nﬁne-grained, high power density thermal hot spots limited the\nperformance of microprocessors. The Memory and Power walls\nsubsequently drove decades of innovations in multi-core scal-\ning [Olukotun et al., 2007], memory consistency and cache co-\nherence [Adve and Gharachorloo, 1996, Hill, 1998, Sorin et al.,\n2011], cache and memory hierarchy optimization [Qureshi et al.,\n2007, Jaleel et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2011, Balasubramonian et al.,\n2011, Sardashti et al., 2015, Balasubramonian, 2019, Jain and\nLin, 2019], network-on-chip design and optimization [Dally\nand Towles, 2001, Wang et al., 2002, Enright and Peh, 2009,\nJerger et al., 2017], and power- and thermal-aware design and\nmanagement [Brooks et al., 2000, Brooks and Martonosi, 2001,\nSkadron et al., 2003, Kaxiras and Martonosi, 2008, Själander\net al., 2014].\nDuring the same period, computations were migrating from\nclient/personal devices to the cloud, demanding signiﬁcant in-\nvestment in large-scale data centers [Barroso and Hölzle, 2009].

PREPRINT\nPervasive Connectivity. In 2021, approximately 65% of the world’s population has access to the internet [Lin,\n2021], and this is expected to improve moving forward. Seamless connectivity will be required for everyday activities\nfrom ordering groceries to driving your car. There are advantages to connectivity from more efﬁcient driving and less\nfood waste, easy access to educational resources, and the ability to work remotely. However, what this also implies is\nthat our lives and livelihoods will be inexorably linked to the accessibility, privacy, security, and resilience of the IT\ninfrastructure.\nReliable internet access for the world’s population is an essential requirement of pervasive connectivity. Despite\nthe positive societal and economical impact, at-scale power delivery and networking infrastructure development has\nproven to be costly and highly geographically-constrained. According to an analysis from the FCC, at least 18 million\nAmericans did not have stable broadband in 2020 [Wheeler, 2020], and many who have access may not be able to\nafford it. According to a recent UN report, two-thirds of school age children do not have access to the internet in their\nhome [unicef, 2020]. Diverse technology innovations are particularly needed to increase information accessibility\nand to connect people of differing needs in the world together in a resilient manner. Microsoft Airband [Microsoft,\na] aims to expand broadband access in rural parts of the United States while Google Loon [Loon] and Facebook\nAquila [Wikipedia] provide affordable high-speed internet to under-connected communities by overcoming physical\nbarriers with innovative technology solutions. The recent success of placing internet communication satellites in low\nEarth orbit opens the door to tremendous opportunities for providing internet access to populations in challenging\ngeographic locations [Starlink]. While satellite communication removes the geographical and political boundaries, it\ncan accelerate the spread of (mis)information. Thus, as technologies continue to enable pervasive connectivity at scale,\nwe must take a deliberate approach to develop technology solutions responsibly.\nAlong with pervasive connectivity comes the requirements for security and privacy given the prevalence of ransomware\nattacks and ongoing privacy hacks from both private groups and nation states. Many aspects of our public and private\nlives will be online and accessible to bad actors, and the internet and the technology it enables will continue to be\nsusceptible without strong security and privacy measures in place from the top of the software stack to the underlying\nhardware running the code [Lipp et al., 2018, Kocher et al., 2019].\nThe IT infrastructure, just like in other critical infrastructure such as telecommunication and power delivery, will require\nbackup and recovery mechanisms in order to minimize or eliminate downtime. These already exist in cloud data centers\nwith examples such as redundant storage [Microsoft, 2021a] and network [Microsoft, 2021b], and backup batteries and\ngenerators. However, redundancy can require signiﬁcant additional hardware and network bandwidth which inﬂates the\ncost of the overall cloud infrastructure.\nRecent climate events are pushing the issue of resiliency to the forefront. In the Texas power outages of 2021, many\ntop-tier data centers were able to continue operations using diesel backup generators. However, there is a limit to how\nlong backup systems can operate given the ﬁnite amount of fuel onsite and weather conditions making it difﬁcult to\ntransport more fuel to the data center [Sverdlik, 2021]. As catastrophic weather events become more common and\nlast longer due to climate change, even the largest data centers may have trouble [Department of Energy, 2019]. For\ninstance, the latest ﬁres in Oregon brought down major power grid infrastructure that connects the grids of California to\nOregon at the same time as a heat wave resulted in a need for additional power for cooling [Roth, 2021]. California\nnarrowly escaped rolling blackouts this time, but these events will continue to increase in intensity and frequency as hot\nand dry conditions lengthen and strengthen the ﬁre season, reduce hydro-electric power due to a lack of water, and\nincrease the need for power for human comfort and survival.\nFor IT infrastructures of the future, a one-size-ﬁts-all solution may not work either for the type of data center or for the\nservices that it provides. Large data centers that require many megawatts to operate may not be viable during a blackout\nwith limited power and where critical operations such as hospitals are given priority.

2021], that implicitly assume power ﬂuctuations and\nvariability.\nAchieving pervasive connectivity in the presence of resiliency, security, and privacy requirements can be challenging\ngiven the interrelated nature of the problems. For instance, current approaches to achieving resilient computing often\nrely on replication and redundancy which not only increases cost but also enlarges the surface of security and privacy\npreservation. Migrating applications to another region, which may be necessary due to power constraints, can expose\ndata to further security threats. To retain physical security of data, applications may be hosted in limited geographical\nregions but this can increase application vulnerability to catastrophic events. In addition, secure and resilient computing\ninfrastructures can often come with signiﬁcant environmental implications. Hence, any computing infrastructure\nsolutions must be cognizant of the multifaceted nature of the problems being addressed.\nSustainability. Resource limitations, climate change, water depletion, electronic waste, ecosystem damage, and\nenvironmental racism are just a few of the topics under the larger sustainability umbrella. There is increased focus on\nthese topics from both industrial and political institutions. All major technology companies have pledged to reduce or\neliminate their carbon footprint in the next decade by reducing the environmental impact associated with manufacturing\nand using their products. Examples of such commitments are Facebook achieving NetZero in operational emissions\nin 2020 and across its value chain by 2030 [Facebook], Apple’s pledge for 100% carbon neutral supply chain by\n2030 [Apple], Microsoft’s goal of being carbon negative by 2030 [Smith], and Google’s aim of 24x7 carbon free data\ncenters [Google, b]. In 2020, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft were the top four technology companies\nthat purchased signiﬁcant renewable energy capacities, accounting for 30% of the cumulative total from corporations\nglobally [Schechner, 2021]. In addition, countries and trading zones are legislating carbon emission requirements.\nChina has committed to be carbon free by 2060 [Myers, 2020] and the EU has committed to cut carbon emissions by\n55% by 2030 [BBC, 2021].\nSustainability targets and the associated regulations will continue to increase, and hardware must be manufactured with\nless planetary impact, use less energy while in operation, and produce less e-waste at the end of life [Orcuttarchive, 2015,\nChang et al., 2017]. Existing practices such as the move to hyperscale data centers have already reduced IT’s carbon\nfootprint by consolidating and sharing computing resources, and operating those resources more efﬁciently (Figure 1)\n– AWS [Amazon, 2019], Azure [Microsoft, 2020], Google cloud [Evans and Gao, 2016], and Facebook datacenter\ninfrastructures [Lee and Rowe, 2020]. In fact, data center electricity consumption has slowed down signiﬁcantly. The\ntotal energy consumption of the US data centers increased by about 4% from 2010-2014, compared with the estimated\n24% increase from 2005-10 and nearly 90% increase from 2000-05 [Masanet et al., 2020]. Furthermore, despite the\nincrease in the global data center energy use, the number of users beneﬁting from the cloud infrastructure have increased\neven more—from 2010-18, the global data center compute instances increased by 5.5 times with an estimated 6%\nincrease in the global data center energy use.\nHowever, more can be done –we must go beyond efﬁciency optimization and build a sustainable ecosystem to achieve\nenvironmentally-sustainable computing. For instance, develop expandable hardware and software stack that facilitate\nsigniﬁcantly longer lifetimes than the current averages of less than 3 years for cell phones [Cordella et al., 2020] and 4\nto 5 years for servers [Ascierto and Lawrence, 2020]. Modular system design will enable component-level upgrades\nwithout having to decommission the system at its entirety, reducing overall electronic waste and the environmental\nfootprint [Fairphone]. Other actions being discussed or implemented require manufacturers to make their systems more\nrepairable, resulting in increased product lifetime [Wiens and Gordon-Byrne, 2017, Alsever, 2021]. Another option is\nto reduce the number of devices in an average household. In the US, for example, the average household is equipped\nwith an average of 25 connected devices [Deloitte, 2021]. In many cases, smartphones might be powerful enough for\nthe task, but a tablet or laptop is needed for a viable keyboard or a larger viewing platform. Some of these additional\ndevices could be replaced with a virtual reality or augmented reality solution that is both portable and can provide\nvirtual keyboards and visual clarity without requiring additional hardware. To achieve an environmentally sustainable\ncomputing future, we will have to build a circular economy for computing that supports the design principle of reduce,\nreuse, repair, and recycle. These and other potential solutions likely require a complete redesign of the software and\nhardware stacks both at the edge, within the cloud, and in the edge-cloud collaborative execution environment, in order\nto provide resilient, long lasting, innovative solutions.\nMaking technology more sustainable is only one part of the technical challenge. There is another side to the story—there\nare signiﬁcant sustainability beneﬁts resulting from computing technology. Programs, such as Farm Beats [Microsoft,\n2015], address how to optimize operations on a farm using technology that is inexpensive and readily available to\npeople in rural areas. Food production accounts for 19% of the world’s carbon emissions, and producing food more\nefﬁciently and with less toxicity has long term beneﬁts for the world [Gates, 2021]. For the residential sector in the\nUS, space heating and cooling contributed to over 40% of the total electricity consumption [U.S. Energy Information\n5", "sentences": [{"text": "Socio-Technological

Another example is the current Covid outbreak. As horrendous as the outbreak has been and continues\nto be, technology has enabled a portion of the economy to continue to operate even as employees work remotely. In\naddition, the global carbon emissions for 2020 dropped by 6.4% with vehicle transportation in the US accounting for a\nportion of the global reduction [Tollefson, 2021]. Looking forward, information technology can improve efﬁciencies\nin practically every sector, from manufacturing to food production to transportation to controlling the climate in our\nhomes and ofﬁces. Although there is a carbon cost associated with manufacturing and operating the IT ecosystem, this\ncost must be evaluated holistically [Chang et al., 2010, Bardon et al., 2020, Gupta et al., 2021, Patterson et al., 2021] in\nlight of the beneﬁts such an ecosystem can provide in other domains [Hager et al., 2019, Tomasev et al., 2020, Mulhern,\n2021, United Nation, 2021].\nDemographic Inclusion. Recent data has pointed to signiﬁcant demographic changes that will be occurring by the\nyear 2100 [V ollset et al., 2020]. These include a radically declining and/or aging population in Europe, North America\nand Asia, and an increasing population of younger workers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Figure 3 shows one population\nprojection using data from the United Nations [Roser, 2019], indicating ﬂattening or decreasing populations in most\nof the world except for Africa. The population decline is strongly correlated with an improved quality of life and\neducational achievement of women – much of which is being facilitated by technologically engendered developments\nsuch as portable devices and the internet – along with access to reproductive services. This trend holds regardless of\nthe country, culture, or religion. These demographic changes will have a seismic impact on all societies, and will also\ndominate what and where technology is designed and deployed, respectively, in the future.\nFor technology to be truly inclusive in a fully-connected world, it must be available and usable foreveryone – regardless\nof physical capabilities, geographic restrictions, or economic constraints. With the projected demographic changes,\nassistive technologies to address the needs of an aging population with physical restrictions will be essential for\nenhancing an individual’s ability to be a viable and contributing member of society.\nFigure 3: Population growth estimation based on United\nNations medium growth projections [Roser, 2019].\nThere is a rich history of intersection between assistive\ntechnology and everyday products.

Close captioning helps\nthe hearing impaired, but it is also used by people with\naverage hearing to capture the conversation in a noisy\nenvironment or to help with accents in the dialogue. The\nreverse is also true – some of the most innovative tech-\nnologies in the last few years are also inclusive of people\nwith physical limitations. Smart speakers, such as Siri\nor Alexa, enable people with limited sight or physical\nmobility to communicate via verbal commands.

Similarly, with the largest population of young\nworkers residing in Africa over the next decades, innovative virtual ofﬁce technology that can create seamless cohesion\nacross geographies and cultures will be critical to economic success. Looking to the future, there is a clear demand\nfor high-quality virtual reality experience in the ﬁrst-person perspective.

availability of the latest computing systems, broadband access, cell towers or power\nsources. However, much of the current world, including parts of developed countries, do not currently have unfettered\naccess to these facilities. Even more daunting, approximately 770 million people, or about 1 out of 10 people in the\nworld, do not have access to a stable supply of electricity [International Energy Agency].\nIn order to meet the upcoming needs of the world, technological growth and resources must focus on under-served\nareas. This includes developing data centers for regions that may not have a resilient power infrastructure or an\ninfrastructure that is based on local renewable energy sources and does not tap into a regional grid. IT devices must be\noperable under adverse conditions where the local network and/or power may not be available 24/7 or varies based on\nexternal conditions [Isaacman and Martonosi, 2011, Hester et al., 2013, Lucia et al., 2017, Saleem et al., 2020]. For\ninstance, devices need to operate for days without a recharge or must operate locally until wireless or broadband is\navailable [Yetim and Martonosi, 2015] to ensure delay tolerance while maintaining user experiences. Energy storage\ntechnology plays a crucial role to smooth the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation but the cost must be\nsigniﬁcantly improved for practical deployment [Plumer, 2021]. And, for technology to be truly inclusive, the way AI\ntechnologies are developed and used must be human-centered, driven by the cultural and demographic differences in\nthe population and with pro-social goals [Stray, 2021]. Furthermore, given its increasingly large impact on the society,\nAI must be developed with deliberation to construct fairer and more inclusive decisions and, at the same time, it must\nbe adopted responsibly [Askell et al., 2019, NIST, 2021]. AI-powered products must be transparent with users on how\ndata is gathered, used, and stored, and with controls to disable it [IBM, Microsoft, b, Google, c, Facebook, DOD].\nFinally, any IT technology must be economically-accessible to most of the world’s population. Unfortunately, even the\nmost basic form of computing devices, a cell phone, is prohibitively expensive for much of the world. According to the\nAlliance for Affordable Internet, nearly 2.5 billion people live in countries where a basic cell phone would cost nearly a\nquarter or more of the average monthly income [Roser, 2020]. Making the internet available to everyone will not solve\nthe problem if the devices commonly used to access the internet are a luxury item for the world’s poor [Naseem et al.,\n2020]. In addition, many of the devices currently being used are inexpensive basic phones. Hence, solutions must be\ndesigned for “dumb” phones in order to reach the poorest communities. Even if users eventually have smartphones, data\nrates and lack of free wiﬁ will limit the utility of data-heavy applications. Without reasonable device and application\navailability for the poorest communities, reaching the goal of pervasive connectivity will be difﬁcult if not impossible\nand the digital divide will continue to widen between the rich and the poor. And, all technological solutions come with\nenvironmental impact that will inadvertently impact the marginalized communities the most. Thus, when developing\ntechnological solutions, we must keep in mind why products are created and for whom, and where technology is\ndesigned and deployed, such that we consciously build environmentally-sustainable, socially-responsible, inclusive\ntechnologies for the next decades to come.\nConclusion\nPredicting the innovations of the future is a difﬁcult if not impossible task. However, the political, societal, and\nenvironmental challenges the world faces are clear, and technology can play a signiﬁcant role in helping societies adapt\nand thrive. The problems and solutions in the three domains of pervasive connectivity, sustainability, and inclusion\nare interconnected and must be addressed holistically. For instance, adapting the IT infrastructure to climate change\nmust not in turn make climate change worse. Making innovative devices and software to address the needs of an\naging population does not mean that poorer populations in other regions can be ignored. And population decline does\nnot fully address sustainability concerns – as standard of living improves with the help of technology, the per-capita\nenvironmental footprint of the population also increases [O’Neill et al., 2018]. Technology must be offered that is\ninclusive of the world’s physical, cultural, and economic diversity, and which is manufactured, used, and recycled with\nenvironmental sustainability at the forefront. We hope to inspire our architecture community to take broader and more\nholistic approaches when developing technologies which include a deeper understanding of the biological, societal,\ncultural, environmental, political, and economic implications of future technological innovations. To summarize:\n• Build resilient, secure infrastructures – software, hardware, and everything in-between – for the computing\nspectrum of systems at all sizes and scales.\n• Design for the entire system life cycle from manufacturing to end-of-life and for the entire software develop-\nment cycle from experimentation to deployment. Build environmentally-sustainable systems, software, and\nalgorithms – beyond energy efﬁciency.\n• Broaden the scope of technologies to serve people from different parts of the world and with differing needs\nby enabling equitable access to technology and the rich economic opportunities it presents.\n7", "sentences": [{"text": "Socio-Technological Challenges and Opportunities: Paths
