Nonethe-\nless, the equally important water (withdrawal and consumption) footprint of AI has largely remained under\nthe radar. For example, training the GPT-3 language model in Microsoft’s state-of-the-art U.S. data centers\ncan directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, but such information has been kept a secret. More\ncritically, the global AI demand is projected to account for 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal\nin 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4 – 6 Denmark or half of the United King-\ndom. This is concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges. To respond\nto the global water challenges, AI can, and also must, take social responsibility and lead by example by ad-\ndressing its own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate the water\nfootprint of AI, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of AI’s runtime water efficiency.\nFinally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to\nenable truly sustainable AI.\n1 Introduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has enabled remarkable breakthroughs in numerous areas of critical importance,\nincluding tackling global challenges such as climate change. On the other hand, many AI models, especially\nlarge generative ones like GPT-4, are trained and deployed on energy-hungry servers in warehouse-scale\ndata centers, accelerating the data center energy consumption at an unprecedented rate [1]. As a result,\nAI’s carbon footprint has been undergoing scrutiny, driving the recent progress in AI carbon efficiency [2,3].\nHowever, AI’s water footprint — many millions of liters of freshwater consumed for cooling the servers and\nfor electricity generation — has largely remained under the radar and keeps escalating. If not properly\naddressed, AI’s water footprint can potentially become a major roadblock to sustainability and create social\nconflicts as freshwater resources suitable for human use are extremely limited and unevenly distributed.\nAs acknowledged in Google’s sustainability report [4] and the recent U.S. data center energy report [1],\nthe expansion of AI products and services is a key driver of the rapid increase in data center water consump-\ntion. Even excluding the water usage in leased third-party colocation facilities, one technology company’s\nself-owned data centers alone directly withdrew 29 billion liters and consumed (i.e., evaporated) more than\n23 billion liters of freshwater for on-site cooling in 2023, nearly 80% of which was potable water [4].2 This\namount of annual water consumption even rivals that of a major household-name beverage company [5].\nImportantly, the company’s data center water consumption increased by∼20% from 2021 to 2022 and by\n∼17% from 2022 to 2023 [4], and another technology company’s data center water consumption saw∼34%\nand ∼22% increases over the same periods, respectively [6]. Furthermore, according to the recent U.S. data\ncenter energy report, the total annual on-site water consumption by U.S. data centers in 2028 could double\nor even quadruple the 2023 level, reaching approximately 150 – 280 billion liters and further stressing the\nwater infrastructures [1].\nAI represents the fastest expanding workloads in data centers [1, 4]. For example, a recent study sug-\ngests that the global AI could consume 85 – 134 TWh of electricity in 2027 [7], whereas a more aggressive\nprojection by the recent U.S. data center energy report predicts that AI servers’ electricity consumption in\nthe U.S. alone will surpass 150 – 300 TWh in 2028 [1]. Even considering the lower estimate, the combined\nscope-1 and scope-2 water withdrawal of global AI is projected to reach 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic metersin\n1Corresponding author: Shaolei Ren (shaolei@ucr.edu), University of California, Riverside.\n2The detailed difference between water withdrawal and water consumption is presented in Section 2.1.\n1\narXiv:2304.03271v5  [cs.LG]  26 Mar 2025\n\n2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4 – 6 Denmark or half of the United King-\ndom.3 Simultaneously, a total of 0.38 – 0.60 billion cubic meters of water will be evaporated and considered\n“consumption” due to the global AI demand in 2027. Moreover, these global estimates will be exceeded by\nthe total water withdrawal and consumption attributed to AI in the U.S. alone in 2028 if the projection in [1]\ncomes to fruition.\nDespite its profound environmental and societal impact, the increasing water footprint of AI has received\ndisproportionately less attention from the AI community as well as the general public. For example, while\nthe scope-2 carbon emissions are routinely included as part of AI model cards, even scope-1 direct water\nusage (either withdrawal or consumption) is missing, let alone scope-2 water usage. This may impede inno-\nvations to enable water sustainability and build truly sustainable AI. Crucially, water and carbon footprints\nare complementary to, not substitutable of, each other for understanding the environmental impacts. In-\ndeed, optimizing for carbon efficiency does not necessarily result in, and may even worsen, water efficiency,\nwhich varies with the fuel mixes for electricity generation and outside weather in a unique way [1,9].\nTo ensure that the growth in AI does not exacerbate the global water stresses or outweigh the environ-\nmental benefits it provides, it is a critical time to uncover and address AI’s hidden water footprint amid the\nincreasingly severe freshwater scarcity crisis, worsened extended droughts, and quickly aging public water\ninfrastructure. The urgency can also be reflected in part by the recent commitment to “Water Positive by\n2030” from industry leaders, including Google [4] and Microsoft [6], and by the inclusion of water foot-\nprint as a key metric into the world’s first international standard on sustainable AI to be published by the\nISO/IEC [10].\nIn this paper, we advocate for a holistic approach to sustainable AI that extends beyond the carbon foot-\nprint to also address the water footprint. Specifically, we present a principled methodology to estimate AI’s\ntotal water footprint, including both operational water and embodied water. By taking the GPT-3 model\nwith 175 billion parameters as an example [11], we show that training GPT-3 in Microsoft’s U.S. data cen-\nters can consume a total of 5.4 million liters of water, including700,000 liters of scope-1 on-site water con-\nsumption. Additionally, GPT-3 needs to “drink” (i.e., consume) a500ml bottle of waterfor roughly 10 – 50\nmedium-length responses, depending on when and where it is deployed.\nNext, we show that WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness, a measure of water efficiency) varies both spatially\nand temporally, suggesting that judiciously deciding “when” and “where” to train a large AI model can\nsignificantly cut the water footprint. We also emphasize the need for increasing transparency of AI’ water\nfootprint, including disclosing more information about operational data and keeping users informed of the\nruntime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along\nwith carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable AI — the water footprint of AI can no longer stay under the\nradar.\n2 Background\n2.1 Water Withdrawal vs. Water Consumption\nThere are two related but different concepts — water withdrawal and water consumption, both of which are\nimportant for understanding the impacts on water stress and availability [12,13].\n• Water withdrawal: It refers to freshwater taken from the ground or surface water sources, either tem-\nporarily or permanently, and then used for agricultural, industrial, or municipal uses (normally excluding\nwater used for hydroelectricity generation) [12]. As water is a finite shared resource, water withdrawal\nindicates the level of competition as well as dependence on water resources among different sectors.\n• Water consumption:It is defined as “water withdrawal minus water discharge”, and means the amount\nof water “evaporated, transpired, incorporated into products or crops, or otherwise removed from the im-\nmediate water environment” [13]. Water consumption reflects the impact on downstream water availability\nand is crucial for assessing watershed-level scarcity [12].\nThese two types of water usage correspond to two different water footprints, i.e., water withdrawal foot-\n3The scope definition of water usage [8] is in line with that of carbon emissions and is discussed in Section 2.2. Our scope-2 water\nwithdrawal (and consumption when applicable) is for location-based electricity generation throughout the paper. Large data centers\noften adopt sustainability programs (e.g., renewable purchasing agreements) to offset their location-based electricity usage and thus\nmay have lower market-based carbon and water footprints.\n2\n\nprint (WWF) [8,14] and water consumption footprint (WCF), respectively [15]. By default, water footprint\nrefers to the water consumption footprint unless otherwise specified.\n2.2 How Does AI Use Water?\nAI’s water usage spans three scopes: on-site water for data center cooling (scope 1), off-site water for elec-\ntricity generation (scope 2), and supply-chain water for server manufacturing (scope 3).\n2.2.1 Scope-1 Water Usage\nNearly all the server energy is converted into heat, which must then be removed from the data center server\nroom to avoid overheating. This process involves two sequential stages: server-level cooling followed by\nfacility-level cooling.\nIn the server-level cooling stage, heat is transferred from the servers to the facility or a heat exchanger,\ntypically using either air or liquid cooling methods (e.g., direct-to-chip cooling or immersion cooling),\nwhich do not evaporate or consume water. In general, new data centers dedicated to AI training often\nrely on liquid cooling due to the high server power densities.\nIn the facility-level cooling stage, heat is rejected from the data center facility to the outside environment.\nWhile there are various cooling methods, water-intensive cooling towers and water evaporation-assisted\nair cooling are two common approaches used in many data centers, including those operated by major\ntechnology companies [1,4].\nData Center\nChilled \nWater\nWarm \nWater\nPump\nCooling \nTower\nServer Rack\nCRAHWater\nSource\nCooling\nTower\nHeat \nExchanger\nChatGPT\n AlphaGO\nPower \nPlant\nScope-1 Water\nScope-2 Water\nFigure 1: An example of data center’s operational water us-\nage: on-site scope-1 water usage for data center cooling (via\ncooling towers in the example), and off-site scope-2 water\nusage for electricity generation. The icons for AI models\nare only for illustration purposes.\nCooling tower. As illustrated in Figure 1, some\nwater is evaporated (i.e., “consumed”) in the cool-\ning tower to dissipate heat into the environment,\nwhile the remaining water moves along an open\nloop to the heat exchanger to further absorb the\nserver heat. Additionally, non-evaporated water\ncan be recycled only a few times (typically 3–10 cy-\ncles, depending on water quality) before discharge,\nrequiring continuous clean freshwater replenish-\nment to prevent mineral and salt buildup. Thus, to\nkeep the cooling tower working, new water must be\nconstantly added to make up for the evaporated wa-\nter and discharged water. Importantly, clean fresh-\nwater (potable water in many cases [4]) is needed\nto avoid pipe clogs and/or bacterial growth.\nFor cooling towers, water withdrawal refers to\nthe amount of added water, including both evapo-\nrated water and discharged water, while water consumption exclusively indicates the amount of evaporated\nwater. With good water quality, roughly 80% of water withdrawal is evaporated and considered “consump-\ntion” [4]. On average, depending on the weather conditions and operational settings, data centers can evap-\norate approximately 1 – 9 liters per kWh of server energy: 1 L/kWh for Google’s annualized global on-site\nwater efficiency [4] and 9 L/kWh for a large commercial data center during the summer in Arizona [16].\nAir cooling with water evaporation assistance.When the climate condition is appropriate, data centers\nmay use “free” outside air to directly reject the heat to the outside environment. Nonetheless, water evapo-\nration is still needed when the outside air is too hot (e.g., higher than 85 degrees Fahrenheit); additionally,\nwater is also needed for humidity control when the outside air is too dry [17]. The added water is consid-\nered “withdrawal”, out of which about 70% is consumed based on Meta’s report [18]. Generally, outside air\ncooling is more water-efficient than cooling towers on average. However, hot weather raises the evaporative\nwater demand and maximum water consumption, potentially stressing local water supplies during peak\ndemand on hot days. Additionally, the application of outside air cooling may have challenges in hot regions\nand/or for many colocation facilities that are located in business districts.\nSome data centers may opt for dry coolers, which consume no on-site water year-round [19]. However,\nthis approach typically increases cooling energy consumption compared to water-based cooling methods,\npotentially exacerbating the overall stress on water resources due to higher scope-2 water consumption.\n3\n\n[Image page=3 idx=1 name=Image16.png] Size: 163x217, Data: 19245 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=2 name=Image19.png] Size: 140x139, Data: 5603 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=3 name=Image32.png] Size: 150x149, Data: 10991 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=4 name=Image34.png] Size: 159x76, Data: 9412 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=5 name=Image38.png] Size: 172x144, Data: 11956 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=6 name=Image40.png] Size: 169x85, Data: 18136 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=7 name=Image43.png] Size: 188x188, Data: 8952 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=8 name=Image44.png] Size: 125x111, Data: 7021 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=9 name=Image45.png] Size: 109x70, Data: 6980 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=10 name=Image8.png] Size: 608x608, Data: 14434 bytes\n\n[Image page=3 idx=11 name=Image91.png] Size: 243x306, Data: 9067 bytes\n\n2.2.2 Scope-2 Water Usage\nIn many countries, thermoelectric power is among the top sectors in terms of water withdrawal and water\nconsumption [8]. Thus, similarly to scope-2 carbon emissions, data centers are accountable for off-site scope-\n2 water usage associated with electricity consumption, which forms part of the “true water cost of data\ncenters,” as highlighted by the recent U.S. data center energy report [1].\nDifferent power plants use different amounts of water for each kWh generation, depending on the cooling\ntechniques. Typically, water withdrawal due to hydropower generation is excluded, but water consumption\ndue to increased water evaporation rates from hydropower generation is included [1]. For electricity gener-\nation, the U.S. national average water withdrawal and consumption are estimated at about 43.8 L/kWh [20]\nand 3.1 L/kWh [8], respectively. Meta’s self-reported scope-2 water consumption for its global data center\nfleet was 3.7 L/kWh (i.e., 55,475 megaliters divided by 14,975,435 MWh) in 2023 [18].\n2.2.3 Scope-3 Water Usage\nAI chip and server manufacturing uses a huge amount of water [21, 22]. For example, ultrapure water is\nneeded for wafer fabrication and water is also needed for keeping semiconductor plants cool. Importantly,\nthe discharged water may contain toxic chemicals and/or hazardous wastes. While water recycling at semi-\nconductor plants can effectively reduce water withdrawal, the recycling rate in many cases remains low, e.g.,\nthe average recycling rate for wafer plants and semiconductor plants in Singapore are 45% and 23%, respec-\ntively [22]. Although largely obscure, scope-3 water usage is likely significant [21]. For instance, Apple\nreports that its supply chain accounts for 99% of its total water footprint [23].\nIt is important to recognize that, unlike agriculture whose water footprint is mostly green (i.e., water\nstored in soil and used by plants), the majority of AI’s water footprint is blue water extracted from rivers,\nlakes, or groundwater, which is directly accessible for human use but often more limited in availability.\n3 Estimating AI’s Water Footprint\nWe present a general methodology for estimating AI’s water consumption footprint. To obtain the water\nwithdrawal footprint, we simply replace the WUE with water withdrawal efficiency.\n3.1 Operational Water Footprint\nWe collectively refer to on-site scope-1 water and off-site scope-2 water as the operational water.\n• On-site WUE. We denote the on-site scope-1 WUE at time t by ρs1,t, which is defined as the ratio of\nthe on-site water consumption to server energy consumption and varies over time depending on the outside\ntemperature (see [9] for an example of on-site WUE based on cooling towers). Concretely, ρs1,t increases\nsignificantly for cooling towers when the outside wet bulb temperature increases, and increases for outside\nair cooling when the outside dry bulb temperature is too hot or the humidity is too low.\n• Off-site WUE. We denote the off-site scope-2 WUE at time t as ρs2,t, which is defined as the ratio\nof off-site water consumption for each kWh of electricity consumption and measures the electricity water\nintensity factor (EWIF). While there are different methods to estimate ρs2,t, a common one is weighted\naveraging: ρs2,t =\nP\nk bk,t×EW IF kP\nk bk,t\nwhere bk,t denotes the amount of electricity generated from fuel type k\nat time t for the grid serving the data center under consideration, and EW IF k is the EWIF for fuel type\nk [24,25]. Thus, variations in energy fuel mixes of electricity generation result in temporal variations of the\noff-site WUE. Moreover, the off-site WUE also varies across regions due to different energy fuel mixes [1,8].\n• Operational water footprint. Consider a time-slotted model t = 1, 2, · · · , T, where the length of each\ntime slot depends on how frequently we want to assess the operational water footprint. At timet, suppose\nthat an AI model uses energyet which can be measured using power meters and/or servers’ built-in tools,\nand the data center hosting the AI model has a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of θt that accounts for\nthe non-IT energy overhead. Then, the total operational water footprint of the AI model can be written as\nW aterOperational = PT\nt=1 et · [ρs1,t + θt · ρs2,t].\n3.2 Embodied Water Footprint\nSimilar to accounting for the embodied carbon footprint [26], the total scope-3 water footprint is amortized\nover the lifespan of a server. Specifically, ifW represents the total water used to manufacture the AI servers\n4\n\nTable 1: Estimate of GPT-3’s operational water consumption footprint. “*” denotes data centers under construction\nas of July 2023, whose PUE and WUE are projected by Microsoft.\nLocation PUE\nOn-site\nWUE\n(L/kWh)\nOff-site\nEWIF\n(L/kWh)\nWater for Training(million L) Water for Each Request(mL) # of Requests\nfor 500ml\nWater\nOn-site\nWater\nOff-site\nWater\nTotal\nWater\nOn-site\nWater\nOff-site\nWater\nTotal\nWater\nU.S. Average 1.170 0.550 3.142 0.708 4.731 5.439 2.200 14.704 16.904 29.6\nArizona 1.180 1.630 4.959 2.098 7.531 9.629 6.520 23.406 29.926 16.7\nGeorgia* 1.120 0.060 2.309 0.077 3.328 3.406 0.240 10.345 10.585 47.2\nIllinois 1.350 0.740 2.233 0.952 3.880 4.833 2.960 12.060 15.020 33.3\nIowa 1.160 0.140 3.104 0.180 4.634 4.814 0.560 14.403 14.963 33.4\nTexas 1.280 0.250 1.287 0.322 2.120 2.442 1.000 6.590 7.590 65.9\nVirginia 1.140 0.140 2.385 0.180 3.499 3.679 0.560 10.875 11.435 43.7\nWashington 1.150 0.950 9.501 1.223 14.063 15.285 3.800 43.706 47.506 10.5\nWyoming 1.110 0.130 2.574 0.167 3.677 3.845 0.520 11.429 11.949 41.8\nAustralia* 1.120 0.012 4.259 0.015 6.138 6.154 0.048 19.078 19.126 26.1\nDenmark* 1.160 0.010 3.180 0.013 4.747 4.760 0.040 14.754 14.794 33.8\nFinland* 1.120 0.010 4.542 0.013 6.548 6.561 0.040 20.350 20.390 24.5\nIndia* 1.430 0.000 3.445 0.000 6.340 6.340 0.000 19.704 19.704 25.4\nIndonesia* 1.320 1.900 2.271 2.445 3.858 6.304 7.600 11.992 19.592 25.5\nIreland 1.190 0.020 1.476 0.026 2.261 2.287 0.080 7.027 7.107 70.4\nMexico* 1.120 0.056 5.300 0.072 7.639 7.711 0.224 23.742 23.966 20.9\nNetherlands 1.140 0.060 3.445 0.077 5.054 5.131 0.240 15.708 15.948 31.4\nSweden 1.160 0.090 6.019 0.116 8.986 9.101 0.360 27.927 28.287 17.7\nand the servers are expected to operate for a period ofT0, then the embodied water footprint over a period\nof T is calculated as W aterEmbodied = T ·W\nT0\nBy adding up the operational and embodied water footprints, we can obtain the total water footprint\nas W aterT otal = PT\nt=1 et · [ρs1,t + θt · ρs2,t] + T ·W\nT0\n. In practice, to obtain a rough estimate, we can use the\naverage values for the annualized WUE and the estimated AI server energy consumption.\n3.3 Case Study: Estimating GPT-3’s Operational Water Consumption Footprint\nThe core of ChatGPT, a popular online service, is a large language model (LLM) based on subsequent ver-\nsions of GPT-3. We present a case study to estimate the operational water consumption for the full GPT-3\nmodel with 175 billion parameters [11]. We exclude embodied water footprint due to the lack of public data\nfor scope-3 water usage. We choose GPT-3 as Microsoft publishes its location-wise WUE and PUE [27,28].\nThe results are summarized in Table 1.\n3.3.1 Training\nGPT-3 was trained and deployed by OpenAI in Microsoft’s data centers, with an estimated training energy\nof 1287 MWh [29]. In line with the practice of estimating the carbon footprint, we use the most recent\nannualized average on-site PUE and WUE for each location, as reported by Microsoft [27, 28]. For power\nplant water efficiency, different references may provide different estimates of EWIF. Thus, for consistency\nacross regions, we use the EWIF provided by [8] to estimate scope-2 water consumption, as it employs the\nsame methodology for calculating EWIF. Moreover, a large number of Microsoft’s data centers are located\nin the U.S., where the average EWIF provided by [8] is 3.14 L/kWh and significantly lower than 4.35 L/kWh\nreported by the recent study [1]. The specific location for training GPT-3 is not public. Thus, we consider\nMicrosoft’s different data center locations, while excluding Singapore and Taiwan as EWIF data for these\nregions is not available in [8].\n3.3.2 Inference\nAs a representative usage scenario for an LLM, we consider a conversation task, which typically includes\na CPU-intensive prompt phase that processes the user’s input (a.k.a., prompt) and a memory-intensive\ntoken phase that produces outputs [30]. More specifically, we consider a medium-sized request, each with\napproximately ≤800 words of input and 150 – 300 words of output [30]. The official estimate indicates that\nGPT-3 consumes an order of 0.4 kWh of electricity to generate 100 pages of content, equivalent to roughly\n0.004 kWh per page [11]. While no details are provided, the estimate likely considers only the GPU energy\nused during token generation.\nTo account for both the prompt phase and the non-GPU energy consumption of servers, we assume a\n5\n\n0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9\nCarbon (kg/kWh)\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16Water (L/kWh)\nAKMS\nHIOA\nMROE\nNWPP\nNYUP\nAZNM\n(a) Carbon/water efficiency\nMON TUE WED THU FRI\n1.5\n1.8\n2.1\n2.4\n2.7\n3.0Water (L/kWh)\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\nCarbon (kg/kWh) (b) Hourly carbon/water efficiency\nMON TUE WED THU FRI\n0\n20\n40\n60Percentage\nCoal\nNatural Gas\nNuclear\nOil\nWind\nSolar\nHydro\nOther (c) Hourly energy fuel mixes\nFigure 2: (a) The U.S. eGRID-level scope-2 water consumption intensity factor vs. carbon emission rate [8, 33].\nThe dashed line represents a linear regression model, showing that the eGRID-level scope-2 carbon emission and water\nconsumption efficiencies are not aligned.(b) A 5-day snapshot of scope-2 carbon emission rate and water consumption\nintensity in Virginia, starting from April 4, 2022.

The PUE, WUE, and EWIF\nare the same as those used for estimating the training water consumption. Our estimate of inference water\nconsumption for GPT-3 is on the conservative side, and the actual water consumption could be several times\nhigher. Specifically, when considering service level objectives (SLOs) for LLM response times in enterprise-\ngrade Nvidia DGX H100 systems for conversation tasks, the inference server energy consumption for a\nmuch smaller model (e.g., Llama-3-70B) is already approximately 0.010 kWh per medium-sized request\nwhen using a state-of-the-art LLM inference solution and accounting for non-GPU server overhead [30]. For\nthe Falcon-180B model, which is comparable in size to GPT-3-175B, the server energy consumption reaches\napproximately 0.016 kWh per medium-sized request [30]. Furthermore, we emphasize that Microsoft’s\ndata centers already have some of the lowest on-site WUE in the industry. If the same model is deployed\nin a third-party colocation data center, the scope-1 direct water consumption is expected to be several times\nhigher. Additionally, our EWIF for the U.S. (3.14 L/kWh) is conservative and significantly lower than the\n4.35 L/kWh recently reported by [1].\nWhile no official information is available on the resource consumption, some subsequent models like\nGPT-4 could consume substantially more energy and water than GPT-3 for processing the same request\n[31, 32]. With continued efforts to reduce AI’s computational demand and improve the overall water effi-\nciency, the water consumption per request may decrease in the future. However, the total water consump-\ntion is likely to continue rising due to the growing demand for AI services and the increasing scale of AI\napplications [1].\n4 Our Recommendations\nWe provide our recommendations to address AI’s water footprint from the scheduling and policy perspec-\ntives, making future AI more environmentally sustainable.\n4.1 More Transparency and Comprehensive Reporting\nDespite its growing importance, AI’s water footprint has received relatively less attention. For example,\nwhile AI model cards routinely include carbon emissions and serve as an important reporting framework\nfor understanding AI’s environmental impacts, they currently omit information on AI’s water consumption.\nThe lack of transparency may obstruct efforts to drive innovations that enhance water sustainability and\nsupport truly sustainable AI. As an initial step to raise awareness among end users about the water resource\nimpacts of their AI usage, we recommend tracking and reporting AI’s water consumption in AI model cards\nand/or through cloud dashboards.\nMoreover, a comprehensive understanding and reporting of AI’s scope-2 water consumption associ-\nated with electricity generation remain limited. Although data centers have increasingly adopted climate-\n6\n\nconscious cooling system designs to minimize on-site water consumption [4,17,19], these efforts primarily\nfocus on scope-1 water usage while largely overlooking scope-2 impacts. Just as addressing scope-2 carbon\nemissions is important for mitigating climate change, it is equally crucial to address scope-2 water con-\nsumption to reduce AI’s “true water cost”, as noted by the recent U.S. data center energy report [1]. To\nbetter reflect the true impacts of data centers on water resources, some technology companies such as Meta\nhave begun to include scope-2 water consumption in their sustainability reports [18]. We recommend the\nreporting of scope-2 water consumption as a standard practice. This approach makes the off-site water\nconsumption visible to AI model developers as well as end users and can unlock new opportunities for\ndemand-side flexibility, thereby alleviating the overall strain on water resources.\nFinally, despite the enormous scope-3 supply-chain water footprint [23], there is limited data available\nfor embodied water usage by chip manufacturing. We recommend further research on scope-3 water con-\nsumption to achieve a comprehensive understanding of AI’s overall water footprint and to foster corporate\nwater stewardship.\n4.2 “When” and “Where” Matter\nJudiciously deciding “when” and “where” to train a large AI model can significantly affect the water foot-\nprint. The water efficiency exhibits a spatial-temporal diversity — on-site water efficiency changes due to\nvariations of outside weather conditions, and off-site water efficiency changes due to variations of the grid’s\nenergy fuel mixes to meet time-varying demands (Figure 2). Therefore, we can dynamically schedule AI\ntraining and inference in a water-wise manner to cut the water footprint. For example, we may schedule\nAI training at midnight and/or in a data center with better water efficiency. Likewise, if informed of the\nreal-time water efficiency, some water-conscious users may prefer to use AI inference during water-efficient\nhours and/or in water-efficient data centers, which can reduce AI’s water footprint by enabling demand-side\nflexibility.\n4.3 “Follow the Sun” or “Unfollow the Sun”\nTo cut the carbon footprint, it is preferable to “follow the sun” when solar energy is more abundant. Nonethe-\nless, to cut the water footprint, it may be more appealing to “unfollow the sun” to avoid high-temperature\nhours of a day when WUE is high. This conflict can also be shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b), where we\nsee misalignment between the scope-2 water consumption intensity factor and carbon emission rate: mini-\nmizing one footprint might increase the other footprint. This observation further corroborates the previous\nfinding that the environmental impacts of carbon and water footprints are not substitutable [1,9]. Therefore,\nto judiciously achieve a balance between “follow the sun” for carbon efficiency and “unfollow the sun” for\nwater efficiency, we need to reconcile the potential water-carbon conflicts by using holistic approaches that\nare both carbon-efficient and water-wise.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we uncover AI’s water usage as a critical concern for socially responsible and environmentally\nsustainable AI. We present a principled methodology to estimate AI’s water footprint. Then, using GPT-\n3 as an example, we show that a large AI model can consume millions of liters of water for training. We\nalso discuss that the scope-1 and scope-2 water efficiencies vary spatially and temporally — judiciously\ndeciding “when” and “where” to run a large AI model can significantly cut the water footprint. In addition,\nwe recommend increased transparency and comprehensive reporting of AI’s water footprint, and highlight\nthe necessity of holistically addressing the water footprint along with the carbon footprint to build truly\nsustainable AI.\nAI’s water footprint can no longer stay under the radar and must be addressed as a priority as part of the collective\nefforts to combat global water challenges.\nReferences\n[1] Arman Shehabi, Sarah J.

Based on the\nformer and more conservative projection, we estimate the potential water usage for global AI in 2027, while\nnoting that our global estimates will be exceeded by the water usage attributed to AI in the U.S. alone in\n2028 if the projection in [1] comes to fruition.\nScope-1 water usage.The scope-1 water efficiency depends on a variety of factors, including the cooling\nsystem designs, climate conditions, and operational settings. To set the global scope-1 water efficiency, we\nutilize the annualized water efficiencies reported by two leading data center operators, Google and Equinix,\nin their latest sustainability reports [4, 34]. Specifically, for on-site scope-1 water withdrawal, we assume\n1.2 L/kWh, which results in a total scope-1 water withdrawal of 0.11 – 0.16 billion cubic meters. Similarly,\nassuming 1.0 L/kWh for global scope-1 water consumption efficiency, we obtain a total on-site scope-1 water\nconsumption of 0.09 – 0.14 billion cubic meters. Note that Google and Equinix both operate data centers\nglobally, but represent two distinct categories of data centers: hyperscale data centers (Google) and multi-\ntenant colocation data centers (Equinix). According to the recent U.S. data center energy report [1], these\ntwo types of data centers collectively account for the vast majority of data center energy consumption in the\nU.S., with colocation data centers consuming slightly more energy than hyperscalers.\nScope-2 water usage. As noted by the recent U.S. data center energy report [1], scope-2 water usage\nis part of the true water cost of data centers. The U.S. average electricity water withdrawal and consump-\ntion intensity factors are both lower than the global averages [8]. Thus, in our estimate, we use the U.S.\naverage electricity water withdrawal intensity factor 43.83 L/kWh [35], and electricity water consumption\nintensity factor 3.14 L/kWh [8], respectively. Note that, since [8] includes hydropower in the calculation,\nit has a higher electricity water withdrawal factor than the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s calcu-\nlation (i.e., 386.07 L/kWh vs. 43.83 L/kWh for the U.S.). Moreover, our value of 3.14 L/kWh for the U.S.\naverage water consumption factor is lower than 4.35 L/kWh reported by [1], as well as lower than Meta’s\nglobal electricity water consumption intensity factor of 3.70 L/kWh in 2024 (i.e., 55,475 megaliters divided\nby 14,975,435 MWh) [18]. Therefore, our choices of 43.83 L/kWh and 3.14 L/kWh for electricity water\nwithdrawal and consumption intensity factors are both on the conservative side, which can partly absorb\npotential over-estimates of global AI’s energy demand in 2027 provided by [7].\nTo account for the data center non-IT energy overheads, we conservatively assume a power usage effec-\ntiveness (PUE) of 1.1, which is a fairly low value even for state-of-the-art data center facilities [4]. Thus,\nAI’s total electricity consumption becomes 93.5 – 147.4 TWh. Thus, after multiplying 43.83 L/kWh and 3.14\nL/kWh by 93.5 – 147.4 TWh, we obtain the total scope-2 water withdrawal of 4.10 – 6.46 billion cubic meters\nand water consumption of 0.29 – 0.46 billion cubic meters, respectively.\nTotal water usage.By adding up scope-1 and scope-2 water usage together, the total water withdrawal\nand water consumption of global AI may reach 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic meters and 0.38 – 0.60 billion cubic\nmeters, respectively. According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency [36], the estimated U.S. annual water\nwithdrawals in Denmark and the United Kingdom in 2020 (the latest year available as of January, 2025) were\n0.98 billion cubic meters and 8.42 billion cubic meters, respectively. Thus, assuming that the 2027 water\nwithdrawals in these two countries remain similar to their 2020 levels, the total water withdrawal attributed\nto global AI in 2027 is projected to surpass the equivalent of the total annual water withdrawal of 4 – 6\nDenmark or approximately half of the United Kingdom. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency [36] does not\nprovide the country-wide annual water consumption information, and hence we do not contextualize the\ntotal water consumption of global AI in 2027.\nThe estimates of global AI’s water usage in 2027 are naturally subject to uncertainties, e.g., the future\nwater efficiency may differ from the current value we use. Nonetheless, we emphasize that our estimates\nare on the conservative side. For example, according to the U.S. data center energy report, the scope-1 water\nconsumption attributed to AI in the U.S. alone could exceed 0.2 billion cubic meters in 2028 [1]. Moreover,\nbased on the reported scope-2 water consumption efficiency, the combined scope-1 and scope-2 water con-\nsumption attributed to AI in the U.S. alone is projected to reach up to about 2 billion cubic meters in 2028 [1],\nwhich is significantly higher than our estimate of global AI’s total water consumption in 2027.\n10", "metadata": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03271", "type": "paper", "year": "2023"}, "sections": [{"title": "Page 1", "paragraphs": [{"text": "Making AI Less “Thirsty”: Uncovering and Addressing the\nSecret Water Footprint of AI Models\nPengfei Li\nUC Riverside\nJianyi Yang\nUC Riverside\nMohammad A.

This is concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges.

On the other hand, many AI models, especially\nlarge generative ones like GPT-4, are trained and deployed on energy-hungry servers in warehouse-scale\ndata centers, accelerating the data center energy consumption at an unprecedented rate [1]. As a result,\nAI’s carbon footprint has been undergoing scrutiny, driving the recent progress in AI carbon efficiency [2,3].\nHowever, AI’s water footprint — many millions of liters of freshwater consumed for cooling the servers and\nfor electricity generation — has largely remained under the radar and keeps escalating. If not properly\naddressed, AI’s water footprint can potentially become a major roadblock to sustainability and create social\nconflicts as freshwater resources suitable for human use are extremely limited and unevenly distributed.\nAs acknowledged in Google’s sustainability report [4] and the recent U.S. data center energy report [1],\nthe expansion of AI products and services is a key driver of the rapid increase in data center water consump-\ntion. Even excluding the water usage in leased third-party colocation facilities, one technology company’s\nself-owned data centers alone directly withdrew 29 billion liters and consumed (i.e., evaporated) more than\n23 billion liters of freshwater for on-site cooling in 2023, nearly 80% of which was potable water [4].2 This\namount of annual water consumption even rivals that of a major household-name beverage company [5].\nImportantly, the company’s data center water consumption increased by∼20% from 2021 to 2022 and by\n∼17% from 2022 to 2023 [4], and another technology company’s data center water consumption saw∼34%\nand ∼22% increases over the same periods, respectively [6]. Furthermore, according to the recent U.S. data\ncenter energy report, the total annual on-site water consumption by U.S. data centers in 2028 could double\nor even quadruple the 2023 level, reaching approximately 150 – 280 billion liters and further stressing the\nwater infrastructures [1].\nAI represents the fastest expanding workloads in data centers [1, 4]. For example, a recent study sug-\ngests that the global AI could consume 85 – 134 TWh of electricity in 2027 [7], whereas a more aggressive\nprojection by the recent U.S. data center energy report predicts that AI servers’ electricity consumption in\nthe U.S. alone will surpass 150 – 300 TWh in 2028 [1].

Moreover, these global estimates will be exceeded by\nthe total water withdrawal and consumption attributed to AI in the U.S. alone in 2028 if the projection in [1]\ncomes to fruition.\nDespite its profound environmental and societal impact, the increasing water footprint of AI has received\ndisproportionately less attention from the AI community as well as the general public. For example, while\nthe scope-2 carbon emissions are routinely included as part of AI model cards, even scope-1 direct water\nusage (either withdrawal or consumption) is missing, let alone scope-2 water usage. This may impede inno-\nvations to enable water sustainability and build truly sustainable AI. Crucially, water and carbon footprints\nare complementary to, not substitutable of, each other for understanding the environmental impacts. In-\ndeed, optimizing for carbon efficiency does not necessarily result in, and may even worsen, water efficiency,\nwhich varies with the fuel mixes for electricity generation and outside weather in a unique way [1,9].\nTo ensure that the growth in AI does not exacerbate the global water stresses or outweigh the environ-\nmental benefits it provides, it is a critical time to uncover and address AI’s hidden water footprint amid the\nincreasingly severe freshwater scarcity crisis, worsened extended droughts, and quickly aging public water\ninfrastructure. The urgency can also be reflected in part by the recent commitment to “Water Positive by\n2030” from industry leaders, including Google [4] and Microsoft [6], and by the inclusion of water foot-\nprint as a key metric into the world’s first international standard on sustainable AI to be published by the\nISO/IEC [10].\nIn this paper, we advocate for a holistic approach to sustainable AI that extends beyond the carbon foot-\nprint to also address the water footprint. Specifically, we present a principled methodology to estimate AI’s\ntotal water footprint, including both operational water and embodied water. By taking the GPT-3 model\nwith 175 billion parameters as an example [11], we show that training GPT-3 in Microsoft’s U.S. data cen-\nters can consume a total of 5.4 million liters of water, including700,000 liters of scope-1 on-site water con-\nsumption. Additionally, GPT-3 needs to “drink” (i.e., consume) a500ml bottle of waterfor roughly 10 – 50\nmedium-length responses, depending on when and where it is deployed.\nNext, we show that WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness, a measure of water efficiency) varies both spatially\nand temporally, suggesting that judiciously deciding “when” and “where” to train a large AI model can\nsignificantly cut the water footprint. We also emphasize the need for increasing transparency of AI’ water\nfootprint, including disclosing more information about operational data and keeping users informed of the\nruntime water efficiency.

For example, ultrapure water is\nneeded for wafer fabrication and water is also needed for keeping semiconductor plants cool.

While water recycling at semi-\nconductor plants can effectively reduce water withdrawal, the recycling rate in many cases remains low, e.g.,\nthe average recycling rate for wafer plants and semiconductor plants in Singapore are 45% and 23%, respec-\ntively [22]. Although largely obscure, scope-3 water usage is likely significant [21]. For instance, Apple\nreports that its supply chain accounts for 99% of its total water footprint [23].\nIt is important to recognize that, unlike agriculture whose water footprint is mostly green (i.e., water\nstored in soil and used by plants), the majority of AI’s water footprint is blue water extracted from rivers,\nlakes, or groundwater, which is directly accessible for human use but often more limited in availability.\n3 Estimating AI’s Water Footprint\nWe present a general methodology for estimating AI’s water consumption footprint. To obtain the water\nwithdrawal footprint, we simply replace the WUE with water withdrawal efficiency.\n3.1 Operational Water Footprint\nWe collectively refer to on-site scope-1 water and off-site scope-2 water as the operational water.\n• On-site WUE. We denote the on-site scope-1 WUE at time t by ρs1,t, which is defined as the ratio of\nthe on-site water consumption to server energy consumption and varies over time depending on the outside\ntemperature (see [9] for an example of on-site WUE based on cooling towers). Concretely, ρs1,t increases\nsignificantly for cooling towers when the outside wet bulb temperature increases, and increases for outside\nair cooling when the outside dry bulb temperature is too hot or the humidity is too low.\n• Off-site WUE. We denote the off-site scope-2 WUE at time t as ρs2,t, which is defined as the ratio\nof off-site water consumption for each kWh of electricity consumption and measures the electricity water\nintensity factor (EWIF). While there are different methods to estimate ρs2,t, a common one is weighted\naveraging: ρs2,t =\nP\nk bk,t×EW IF kP\nk bk,t\nwhere bk,t denotes the amount of electricity generated from fuel type k\nat time t for the grid serving the data center under consideration, and EW IF k is the EWIF for fuel type\nk [24,25]. Thus, variations in energy fuel mixes of electricity generation result in temporal variations of the\noff-site WUE. Moreover, the off-site WUE also varies across regions due to different energy fuel mixes [1,8].\n• Operational water footprint. Consider a time-slotted model t = 1, 2, · · · , T, where the length of each\ntime slot depends on how frequently we want to assess the operational water footprint. At timet, suppose\nthat an AI model uses energyet which can be measured using power meters and/or servers’ built-in tools,\nand the data center hosting the AI model has a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of θt that accounts for\nthe non-IT energy overhead. Then, the total operational water footprint of the AI model can be written as\nW aterOperational = PT\nt=1 et · [ρs1,t + θt · ρs2,t].\n3.2 Embodied Water Footprint\nSimilar to accounting for the embodied carbon footprint [26], the total scope-3 water footprint is amortized\nover the lifespan of a server.

We present a case study to estimate the operational water consumption for the full GPT-3\nmodel with 175 billion parameters [11]. We exclude embodied water footprint due to the lack of public data\nfor scope-3 water usage. We choose GPT-3 as Microsoft publishes its location-wise WUE and PUE [27,28].\nThe results are summarized in Table 1.\n3.3.1 Training\nGPT-3 was trained and deployed by OpenAI in Microsoft’s data centers, with an estimated training energy\nof 1287 MWh [29]. In line with the practice of estimating the carbon footprint, we use the most recent\nannualized average on-site PUE and WUE for each location, as reported by Microsoft [27, 28]. For power\nplant water efficiency, different references may provide different estimates of EWIF. Thus, for consistency\nacross regions, we use the EWIF provided by [8] to estimate scope-2 water consumption, as it employs the\nsame methodology for calculating EWIF. Moreover, a large number of Microsoft’s data centers are located\nin the U.S., where the average EWIF provided by [8] is 3.14 L/kWh and significantly lower than 4.35 L/kWh\nreported by the recent study [1]. The specific location for training GPT-3 is not public. Thus, we consider\nMicrosoft’s different data center locations, while excluding Singapore and Taiwan as EWIF data for these\nregions is not available in [8].\n3.3.2 Inference\nAs a representative usage scenario for an LLM, we consider a conversation task, which typically includes\na CPU-intensive prompt phase that processes the user’s input (a.k.a., prompt) and a memory-intensive\ntoken phase that produces outputs [30]. More specifically, we consider a medium-sized request, each with\napproximately ≤800 words of input and 150 – 300 words of output [30]. The official estimate indicates that\nGPT-3 consumes an order of 0.4 kWh of electricity to generate 100 pages of content, equivalent to roughly\n0.004 kWh per page [11]. While no details are provided, the estimate likely considers only the GPU energy\nused during token generation.\nTo account for both the prompt phase and the non-GPU energy consumption of servers, we

primarily\nfocus on scope-1 water usage while largely overlooking scope-2 impacts. Just as addressing scope-2 carbon\nemissions is important for mitigating climate change, it is equally crucial to address scope-2 water con-\nsumption to reduce AI’s “true water cost”, as noted by the recent U.S. data center energy report [1]. To\nbetter reflect the true impacts of data centers on water resources, some technology companies such as Meta\nhave begun to include scope-2 water consumption in their sustainability reports [18]. We recommend the\nreporting of scope-2 water consumption as a standard practice. This approach makes the off-site water\nconsumption visible to AI model developers as well as end users and can unlock new opportunities for\ndemand-side flexibility, thereby alleviating the overall strain on water resources.\nFinally, despite the enormous scope-3 supply-chain water footprint [23], there is limited data available\nfor embodied water usage by chip manufacturing. We recommend further research on scope-3 water con-\nsumption to achieve a comprehensive understanding of AI’s overall water footprint and to foster corporate\nwater stewardship.\n4.2 “When” and “Where” Matter\nJudiciously deciding “when” and “where” to train a large AI model can significantly affect the water foot-\nprint. The water efficiency exhibits a spatial-temporal diversity — on-site water efficiency changes due to\nvariations of outside weather conditions, and off-site water efficiency changes due to variations of the grid’s\nenergy fuel mixes to meet time-varying demands (Figure 2). Therefore, we can dynamically schedule AI\ntraining and inference in a water-wise manner to cut the water footprint. For example, we may schedule\nAI training at midnight and/or in a data center with better water efficiency. Likewise, if informed of the\nreal-time water efficiency, some water-conscious users may prefer to use AI inference during water-efficient\nhours and/or in water-efficient data centers, which can reduce AI’s water footprint by enabling demand-side\nflexibility.\n4.3 “Follow the Sun” or “Unfollow the Sun”\nTo cut the carbon footprint, it is preferable to “follow the sun” when solar energy is more abundant. Nonethe-\nless, to cut the water footprint, it may be more appealing to “unfollow the sun” to avoid high-temperature\nhours of a day when WUE is high. This conflict can also be shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b), where we\nsee misalignment between the scope-2 water consumption intensity factor and carbon emission rate: mini-\nmizing one footprint might increase the other footprint. This observation further corroborates the previous\nfinding that the environmental impacts of carbon and water footprints are not substitutable [1,9]. Therefore,\nto judiciously achieve a balance between “follow the sun” for carbon efficiency and “unfollow the sun” for\nwater efficiency, we need to reconcile the potential water-carbon conflicts by using holistic approaches that\nare both carbon-efficient and water-wise.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we uncover AI’s water usage as a critical concern for socially responsible and environmentally\nsustainable AI. We present a principled methodology to estimate AI’s water footprint. Then, using GPT-\n3 as an example, we show that a large AI model can consume millions of liters of water for training. We\nalso discuss that the scope-1 and scope-2 water efficiencies vary spatially and temporally — judiciously\ndeciding “when” and “where” to run a large AI model can significantly cut the water footprint. In addition,\nwe recommend increased transparency and comprehensive reporting of AI’s water footprint, and highlight\nthe necessity of holistically addressing the water footprint along with the carbon footprint to build truly\nsustainable AI.\nAI’s water footprint can no longer stay under the radar and must be addressed as a priority as part of the collective\nefforts to combat global water challenges.\nReferences\n[1] Arman Shehabi, Sarah J.

recent study suggests that the global AI could consume 85 – 134 TWh of electricity in 2027 based on the\nGPU shipment [7], whereas a more aggressive estimate by the U.S. data center energy report projects that\nAI servers’ electricity consumption in the U.S. alone will surpass 150 – 300 TWh in 2028 [1]. Based on the\nformer and more conservative projection, we estimate the potential water usage for global AI in 2027, while\nnoting that our global estimates will be exceeded by the water usage attributed to AI in the U.S. alone in\n2028 if the projection in [1] comes to fruition.\nScope-1 water usage.The scope-1 water efficiency depends on a variety of factors, including the cooling\nsystem designs, climate conditions, and operational settings. To set the global scope-1 water efficiency, we\nutilize the annualized water efficiencies reported by two leading data center operators, Google and Equinix,\nin their latest sustainability reports [4, 34]. Specifically, for on-site scope-1 water withdrawal, we assume\n1.2 L/kWh, which results in a total scope-1 water withdrawal of 0.11 – 0.16 billion cubic meters. Similarly,\nassuming 1.0 L/kWh for global scope-1 water consumption efficiency, we obtain a total on-site scope-1 water\nconsumption of 0.09 – 0.14 billion cubic meters. Note that Google and Equinix both operate data centers\nglobally, but represent two distinct categories of data centers: hyperscale data centers (Google) and multi-\ntenant colocation data centers (Equinix). According to the recent U.S. data center energy report [1], these\ntwo types of data centers collectively account for the vast majority of data center energy consumption in the\nU.S., with colocation data centers consuming slightly more energy than hyperscalers.\nScope-2 water usage. As noted by the recent U.S. data center energy report [1], scope-2 water usage\nis part of the true water cost of data centers. The U.S. average electricity water withdrawal and consump-\ntion intensity factors are both lower than the global averages [8]. Thus, in our estimate, we use the U.S.\naverage electricity water withdrawal intensity factor 43.83 L/kWh [35], and electricity water consumption\nintensity factor 3.14 L/kWh [8], respectively. Note that, since [8] includes hydropower in the calculation,\nit has a higher electricity water withdrawal factor than the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s calcu-\nlation (i.e., 386.07 L/kWh vs. 43.83 L/kWh for the U.S.). Moreover, our value of 3.14 L/kWh for the U.S.\naverage water consumption factor is lower than 4.35 L/kWh reported by [1], as well as lower than Meta’s\nglobal electricity water consumption intensity factor of 3.70 L/kWh in 2024 (i.e., 55,475 megaliters divided\nby 14,975,435 MWh) [18]. Therefore, our choices of 43.83 L/kWh and 3.14 L/kWh for electricity water\nwithdrawal and consumption intensity factors are both on the conservative side, which can partly absorb\npotential over-estimates of global AI’s energy demand in 2027 provided by [7].\nTo account for the data center non-IT energy overheads, we conservatively assume a power usage effec-\ntiveness (PUE) of 1.1, which is a fairly low value even for state-of-the-art data center facilities [4]. Thus,\nAI’s total electricity consumption becomes 93.5 – 147.4 TWh. Thus, after multiplying 43.83 L/kWh and 3.14\nL/kWh by 93.5 – 147.4 TWh, we obtain the total scope-2 water withdrawal of 4.10 – 6.46 billion cubic meters\nand water consumption of 0.29 – 0.46 billion cubic meters, respectively.\nTotal water usage.By adding up scope-1 and scope-2 water usage together, the total water withdrawal\nand water consumption of global AI may reach 4.2 – 6.6 billion cubic meters and 0.38 – 0.60 billion cubic\nmeters, respectively. According to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency [36], the estimated U.S. annual water\nwithdrawals in Denmark and the United Kingdom in 2020 (the latest year available as of January, 2025) were\n0.98 billion cubic meters and 8.42 billion cubic meters, respectively. Thus, assuming that the 2027 water\nwithdrawals in these two countries remain similar to their 2020 levels, the total water withdrawal attributed\nto global AI in 2027 is projected to surpass the equivalent of the total annual water withdrawal of 4 – 6\nDenmark or approximately half of the United Kingdom. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency [36] does not\nprovide the country-wide annual water consumption information, and hence we do not contextualize the\ntotal water consumption of global AI in 2027.\nThe estimates of global AI’s water usage in 2027 are naturally subject to uncertainties, e.g., the future\nwater efficiency may differ from the current value we use. Nonetheless, we emphasize that our estimates\nare on the conservative side. For example, according to the U.S. data center energy report, the scope-1 water\nconsumption attributed to AI in the U.S. alone could exceed 0.2 billion cubic meters in 2028 [1]. Moreover,\nbased on the reported scope-2 water consumption efficiency, the combined scope-1 and scope-2 water con-\nsumption attributed to AI in the U.S. alone is projected to reach up to about 2 billion cubic meters in 2028 [1],\nwhich is significantly higher than our estimate of global AI’s total water consumption in 2027.\n10", "sentences": [{"text": "Appendix: Operational Water for Global
