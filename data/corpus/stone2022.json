It \nconsiders the science, engineering, \nand deployment of  AI-enabled \ncomputing systems. As its core \nactivity , the Standing Committee \nthat oversees the One Hundred \nY ear Study forms a Study Panel \nevery five years to assess the \ncurrent state of  AI. The Study \nPanel reviews AI’s progress in the years following the immediately prior report, \nenvisions the potential advances that lie ahead, and describes the technical and \nsocietal challenges and opportunities these advances raise, including in such arenas as \nethics, economics, and the design of  systems compatible with human cognition. The \noverarching purpose of  the One Hundred Y ear Study’s periodic expert review is to \nprovide a collected and connected set of  reflections about AI and its influences as the \nfield advances. The studies are expected to develop syntheses and assessments that \nprovide expert-informed guidance for directions in  \nAI research, development, and systems design, as well as programs and policies to \nhelp ensure that these systems broadly benefit individuals and society .1 \nThe One Hundred Y ear Study is modeled on an earlier effort informally known as \nthe “ AAAI Asilomar Study .” During 2008-2009, the then president of  the Association \nfor the Advancement of  Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Eric Horvitz, assembled a \ngroup of  AI experts from multiple institutions and areas of  the field, along with \nscholars of  cognitive science, philosophy , and law . Working in distributed subgroups, \nthe participants addressed near-term AI developments, long-term possibilities, \nand legal and ethical concerns, and then came together in a three-day meeting at \nAsilomar to share and discuss their findings. A short written report on the intensive \nmeeting discussions, amplified by the participants’ subsequent discussions with other \ncolleagues, generated widespread interest and debate in the field and beyond. \nThe impact of  the Asilomar meeting, and important advances in AI that included \nAI algorithms and technologies starting to enter daily life around the globe, spurred \nthe idea of  a long-term recurring study of  AI and its influence on people and society . \nThe One Hundred Y ear Study was subsequently endowed at a university to enable \n1 “One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100),” Stanford University, accessed \nAugust 1, 2016, https://ai100.stanford.edu.\nThe overarching purpose \nof the One Hundred Year \nStudy’s periodic expert \nreview is to provide a \ncollected and connected \nset of reflections about  \nAI and its influences as  \nthe field advances.\n\n[Image page=1 idx=1 name=Im0.jpg] Size: 1440x800, Data: 324521 bytes\n\n2\nextended deep thought and cross-disciplinary scholarly investigations that could \ninspire innovation and provide intelligent advice to government agencies and industry .\nThis report is the first in the planned series of  studies that will continue for at least \na hundred years. The Standing Committee defined a Study Panel charge for the \ninaugural Study Panel in the summer of  2015 and recruited Professor Peter Stone, \nat the University of  Texas at Austin, to chair the panel. The seventeen-member \nStudy Panel, comprised of  experts in AI from academia, corporate laboratories \nand industry , and AI-savvy scholars in law , political science, policy , and economics, \nwas launched in mid-fall 2015. The participants represent diverse specialties and \ngeographic regions, genders, and career stages. \nThe Standing Committee extensively discussed ways to frame the Study Panel \ncharge to consider both recent advances in AI and potential societal impacts on jobs, \nthe environment, transportation, public safety , healthcare, community engagement, \nand government. The committee considered various ways to focus the study , \nincluding surveying subfields and their status, examining a particular technology \nsuch as machine learning or natural language processing, and studying particular \napplication areas such as healthcare or transportation. The committee ultimately \nchose a thematic focus on “ AI and Life in 2030” to recognize that AI’s various uses \nand impacts will not occur independently of  one another, or of  a multitude of  other \nsocietal and technological developments. Acknowledging the central role cities have \nplayed throughout most of  human experience, the focus was narrowed to the large \nurban areas where most people live. The Standing Committee further narrowed the \nfocus to a typical North American city in recognition of  the great variability of  urban \nsettings and cultures around the world, and limits on the first Study Panel’s efforts. \nThe Standing Committee expects that the projections, assessments, and proactive \nguidance stemming from the study will have broader global relevance and is making \nplans for future studies to expand the scope of  the project internationally .\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPREFACE\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY 4\nOVERVIEW 6\nSECTION I: WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? 12\nDefining AI 12\nAI Research Trends 14\nSECTION II: AI BY DOMAIN 18\nTransportation 18\nHome/Service Robots 24\nHealthcare 25\nEducation 31\nLow-resource Communities 35\nPublic Safety and Security 36\nEmployment and Workplace 38\nEntertainment 40\nSECTION III: PROSPECTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AI PUBLIC POLICY 42\nAI Policy, Now and in the Future 42\nAPPENDIX I: A SHORT HISTORY OF AI 50\n\n3\nAs one consequence of  the decision to focus on life in North American cities, \nmilitary applications were deemed to be outside the scope of  this initial report. This \nis not to minimize the importance of  careful monitoring and deliberation about \nthe implications of  AI advances for defense and warfare, including potentially \ndestabilizing developments and deployments.\nThe report is designed to address four intended audiences. For the general public, \nit aims to provide an accessible, scientifically and technologically accurate portrayal \nof  the current state of  AI and its potential. For industry , the report describes relevant \ntechnologies and legal and ethical challenges, and may help guide resource allocation. \nThe report is also directed to local, national, and international governments to help \nthem better plan for AI in governance. Finally , the report can help AI researchers, \nas well as their institutions and funders, to set priorities and consider the ethical and \nlegal issues raised by AI research and its applications. \nGiven the unique nature of  the One Hundred Y ear Study on AI, we expect that \nfuture generations of  Standing Committees and Study Panels, as well as research \nscientists, policy experts, leaders in the private and public sectors, and the general \npublic, will reflect on this assessment as they make new assessments of  AI’s future. We \nhope that this first effort in the series stretching out before us will be useful for both its \nfailures and successes in accurately predicting the trajectory and influences of  AI.\nThe Standing Committee is grateful to the members of  the Study Panel for \ninvesting their expertise, perspectives, and significant time to the creation of  this \ninaugural report.

While the \nrate of  progress in AI has been patchy and unpredictable, there have been significant \nadvances since the field’s inception sixty years ago. Once a mostly academic area of   \nstudy , twenty-first century AI enables a constellation of  mainstream technologies that  \nare having a substantial impact on everyday lives. Computer vision and AI planning, \nfor example, drive the video games that are now a bigger entertainment industry than  \nHollywood. Deep learning, a form of  machine learning based on layered representations \nof  variables referred to as neural networks, has made speech-understanding practical \non our phones and in our kitchens, and its algorithms can be applied widely to an \narray of  applications that rely on pattern recognition. Natural Language Processing \n(NLP) and knowledge representation and reasoning have enabled a machine to beat \nthe Jeopardy champion and are bringing new power to Web searches. \nWhile impressive, these technologies are highly tailored to particular tasks. Each \napplication typically requires years of  specialized research and careful, unique \nconstruction. In similarly targeted applications, substantial increases in the future \nuses of  AI technologies, including more self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics \nand targeted treatments, and physical assistance for elder care can be expected. AI \nand robotics will also be applied across the globe in industries struggling to attract \nyounger workers, such as agriculture, food processing, fulfillment centers, and \nfactories. They will facilitate delivery of  online purchases through flying drones,  \nself-driving trucks, or robots that can get up the stairs to the front door.\nThis report is the first in a series to be issued at regular intervals as a part of  the \nOne Hundred Y ear Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100). Starting from a charge \ngiven by the AI100 Standing Committee to consider the likely influences of  AI in a  \ntypical North American city by the year 2030, the 2015 Study Panel, comprising experts  \nin AI and other relevant areas focused their attention on eight domains they considered  \nmost salient: transportation; service robots; healthcare; education; low-resource \ncommunities; public safety and security; employment and workplace; and entertainment. \nIn each of  these domains, the report both reflects on progress in the past fifteen years  \nand anticipates developments in the coming fifteen years. Though drawing from a  \ncommon source of  research, each domain reflects different AI influences and challenges, \nsuch as the difficulty of  creating safe and reliable hardware (transportation and service \nrobots), the difficulty of  smoothly interacting with human experts (healthcare and  \neducation), the challenge of  gaining public trust (low-resource communities and public  \nsafety and security), the challenge of  overcoming fears of  marginalizing humans \n(employment and workplace), and the social and societal risk of  diminishing interpersonal \ninteractions (entertainment). The report begins with a reflection on what constitutes \nArtificial Intelligence, and concludes with recommendations concerning AI-related \npolicy . These recommendations include accruing technical expertise about AI in \ngovernment and devoting more resources—and removing impediments—to research \non the fairness, security , privacy , and societal impacts of  AI systems.\nContrary to the more fantastic predictions for AI in the popular press, the Study \nPanel found no cause for concern that AI is an imminent threat to humankind. \nNo machines with self-sustaining long-term goals and intent have been developed, \nnor are they likely to be developed in the near future. Instead, increasingly useful \napplications of  AI, with potentially profound positive impacts on our society and  \neconomy are likely to emerge between now and 2030, the period this report \nconsiders. At the same time, many of  these developments will spur disruptions in \nSubstantial increases \nin the future uses of AI \napplications, including \nmore self-driving cars, \nhealthcare diagnostics \nand targeted treatment, \nand physical assistance \nfor elder care can be \nexpected.\n\n5\nhow human labor is augmented or replaced by AI, creating new challenges for the \neconomy and society more broadly . Application design and policy decisions made in \nthe near term are likely to have long-lasting influences on the nature and directions \nof  such developments, making it important for AI researchers, developers, social \nscientists, and policymakers to balance the imperative to innovate with mechanisms \nto ensure that AI’s economic and social benefits are broadly shared across society . If  \nsociety approaches these technologies primarily with fear and suspicion, missteps that \nslow AI’s development or drive it underground will result, impeding important work \non ensuring the safety and reliability of  AI technologies. On the other hand, if  society \napproaches AI with a more open mind, the technologies emerging from the field \ncould profoundly transform society for the better in the coming decades.\nStudy Panel: Peter Stone, Chair, University of Texas at Austin, Rodney Brooks, \nRethink Robotics, Erik Brynjolfsson, Massachussets Institute of Technology, Ryan \nCalo, University of Washington, Oren Etzioni, Allen Institute for AI, Greg Hager, Johns \nHopkins University, Julia Hirschberg, Columbia University, Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan, \nIndian Institute of Technology Bombay, Ece Kamar, Microsoft Research, Sarit Kraus, \nBar Ilan University.

Each application \nrequires years of focused \nresearch and a careful, \nunique construction.\n\n6\nOVERVIEW\nThe frightening, futurist portrayals of  Artificial Intelligence that dominate films and \nnovels, and shape the popular imagination, are fictional. In reality , AI is already \nchanging our daily lives, almost entirely in ways that improve human health, safety , \nand productivity . Unlike in the movies, there is no race of  superhuman robots on the \nhorizon or probably even possible. And while the potential to abuse AI technologies \nmust be acknowledged and addressed, their greater potential is, among other things, \nto make driving safer, help children learn, and extend and enhance people’s lives. In \nfact, beneficial AI applications in schools, homes, and hospitals are already growing \nat an accelerated pace. Major research universities devote departments to AI studies, \nand technology companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft \nspend heavily to explore AI applications they regard as critical to their futures. Even \nHollywood uses AI technologies to bring its dystopian AI fantasies to the screen.\nInnovations relying on computer-based vision, speech recognition, and Natural \nLanguage Processing have driven these changes, as have concurrent scientific and \ntechnological advances in related fields. AI is also changing how people interact with \ntechnology . Many people have already grown accustomed to touching and talking to  \ntheir smart phones. People’s future relationships with machines will become ever more  \nnuanced, fluid, and personalized as AI systems learn to adapt to individual personalities \nand goals. These AI applications will help monitor people’s well-being, alert them to  \nrisks ahead, and deliver services when needed or wanted. For example, in a mere \nfifteen years in a typical North American city—the time frame and scope of  this report—\nAI applications are likely to transform transportation toward self-driving vehicles with \non-time pickup and delivery of  people and packages. This alone will reconfigure the \nurban landscape, as traffic jams and parking challenges become obsolete.\nThis study’s focus on a typical North American city is deliberate and meant to \nhighlight specific changes affecting the everyday lives of  the millions of  people who \ninhabit them. The Study Panel further narrowed its inquiry to eight domains where \nAI is already having or is projected to have the greatest impact: transportation, \nhealthcare, education, low-resource communities, public safety and security , \nemployment and workplace, home/service robots, and entertainment.\nThough drawing from a common source of  research, AI technologies have \ninfluenced and will continue to influence these domains differently . Each domain \nfaces varied AI-related challenges, including the difficulty of  creating safe and reliable \nhardware for sensing and effecting (transportation and service robots), the difficulty \nof  smoothly interacting with human experts (healthcare and education), the challenge \nof  gaining public trust (low-resource communities and public safety and security), the \nchallenge of  overcoming fears of  marginalizing humans (employment and workplace) \nand the risk of  diminishing interpersonal interaction (entertainment). Some domains \nare primarily business sectors, such as transportation and healthcare, while others are \nmore oriented to consumers, such as entertainment and home service robots. Some \ncut across sectors, such as employment/workplace and low-resource communities.\nIn each domain, even as AI continues to deliver important benefits, it also raises \nimportant ethical and social issues, including privacy concerns. Robots and other AI \ntechnologies have already begun to displace jobs in some sectors. As a society , we are now \nat a crucial juncture in determining how to deploy AI-based technologies in ways that \npromote, not hinder, democratic values such as freedom, equality , and transparency . For \nindividuals, the quality of  the lives we lead and how our contributions are valued are \nlikely to shift gradually , but markedly . Over the next several years, AI research, systems \ndevelopment, and social and regulatory frameworks will shape how the benefits of  AI \nare weighed against its costs and risks, and how broadly these benefits are spread.\nMany have already grown \naccustomed to touching \nand talking to their \nsmart phones. People’s \nfuture relationships with \nmachines will become ever \nmore nuanced, fluid, and \npersonalized.\n\n7\nAn accurate and sophisticated picture of  AI—one that competes with its popular \nportrayal—is hampered at the start by the difficulty of  pinning down a precise \ndefinition of  artificial intelligence. In the approaches the Study Panel considered, \nnone suggest there is currently a “general purpose” AI. While drawing on common \nresearch and technologies, AI systems are specialized to accomplish particular \ntasks, and each application requires years of  focused research and a careful, unique \nconstruction. As a result, progress is uneven within and among the eight domains.\nA prime example is Transportation, where a few key technologies have catalyzed \nthe widespread adoption of  AI with astonishing speed. Autonomous transportation \nwill soon be commonplace and, as most people’s first experience with physically \nembodied AI systems, will strongly influence the public’s perception of  AI. As cars \nbecome better drivers than people, city-dwellers will own fewer cars, live further from \nwork, and spend time differently , leading to an entirely new urban organization. In \nthe typical North American city in 2030, physically embodied AI applications will \nnot be limited to cars, but are likely to include trucks, flying vehicles, and personal \nrobots. Improvements in safe and reliable hardware will spur innovation over the next \nfifteen years, as they will with Home/Service Robots, which have already entered \npeople’s houses, primarily in the form of  vacuum cleaners. Better chips, low-cost 3D \nsensors, cloud-based machine learning, and advances in speech understanding will \nenhance future robots’ services and their interactions with people. Special purpose \nrobots will deliver packages, clean offices, and enhance security . But technical \nconstraints and the high costs of  reliable mechanical devices will continue to limit \ncommercial opportunities to narrowly defined applications for the foreseeable future.\nIn Healthcare, there has been an immense forward leap in collecting useful data  \nfrom personal monitoring devices and mobile apps, from electronic health records (EHR)  \nin clinical settings and, to a lesser extent, from surgical robots designed to assist with \nmedical procedures and service robots supporting hospital operations. AI-based \napplications could improve health outcomes and the quality of  life for millions of  \npeople in the coming years. Though clinical applications have been slow to move from  \nthe computer science lab to the real-world, there are hopeful signs that the pace of   \ninnovation will improve. Advances in healthcare can be promoted via the development \nof  incentives and mechanisms for sharing data and for removing overbearing policy , \nregulatory , and commercial obstacles. For many applications, AI systems will have to work  \nclosely with care providers and patients to gain their trust. Advances in how intelligent \nmachines interact naturally with caregivers, patients, and patients’ families are crucial.\nEnabling more fluid interactions between people and promising AI technologies \nalso remains a critical challenge in Education, which has seen considerable progress \nin the same period. Though quality education will always require active engagement \nby human teachers, AI promises to enhance education at all levels, especially by \nproviding personalization at scale. Interactive machine tutors are now being matched \nto students for teaching science, math, language, and other disciplines. Natural \nLanguage Processing, machine learning, and crowdsourcing have boosted online \nlearning and enabled teachers in higher education to multiply the size of  their \nclassrooms while addressing individual students’ learning needs and styles. Over the \nnext fifteen years in a typical North American city , the use of  these technologies in \nthe classroom and in the home is likely to expand significantly , provided they can be \nmeaningfully integrated with face-to-face learning.\nBeyond education, many opportunities exist for AI methods to assist  \nLow-resource Communities by providing mitigations and solutions to a  \nvariety of  social problems. Traditionally , funders have underinvested in AI research \nlacking commercial application. With targeted incentives and funding priorities,  \nSociety is now at a crucial \njuncture in determining \nhow to deploy AI-based \ntechnologies in ways that \npromote rather than hinder \ndemocratic values such \nas freedom, equality, and \ntransparency.\n\n8\nAI technologies could help address the needs of  low-resource communities, and \nbudding efforts are promising. Using data mining and machine learning, for example, \nAI has been used to create predictive models to help government agencies address \nissues such as prevention of  lead poisoning in at-risk children and distribution of   \nfood efficiently . These budding efforts suggest more could be done, particularly if   \nagencies and organizations can engage and build trust with these communities. \nGaining public trust is also a challenge for AI use by Public Safety and Security \nprofessionals. North American cities and federal agencies have already begun to \ndeploy AI technologies in border administration and law enforcement. By 2030,  \nthey will rely heavily upon them, including improved cameras and drones for \nsurveillance, algorithms to detect financial fraud, and predictive policing. The latter \nraises the specter of  innocent people being unjustifiably monitored, and care must be \ntaken to avoid systematizing human bias and to protect civil liberties. Well-deployed \nAI prediction tools have the potential to provide new kinds of  transparency about \ndata and inferences, and may be applied to detect, remove, or reduce human bias, \nrather than reinforcing it.\nSocial and political decisions are likewise at play in AI’s influences on \nEmployment and Workplace trends, such as the safety nets needed to protect \npeople from structural changes in the economy . AI is poised to replace people in \ncertain kinds of  jobs, such as in the driving of  taxis and trucks. However, in many \nrealms, AI will likely replace tasks rather than jobs in the near term, and will also \ncreate new kinds of  jobs. But the new jobs that will emerge are harder to imagine in  \nadvance than the existing jobs that will likely be lost. AI will also lower the cost of  \nmany goods and services, effectively making everyone better off. Longer term, AI may  \nbe thought of  as a radically different mechanism for wealth creation in which everyone \nshould be entitled to a portion of  the world’s AI-produced treasures. It is not too soon \nfor social debate on how the economic fruits of  AI technologies should be shared.\nEntertainment has been transformed by social networks and other platforms for  \nsharing and browsing blogs, videos, and photos, which rely on techniques actively \ndeveloped in NLP , information retrieval, image processing, crowdsourcing, and machine \nlearning. Some traditional sources of  entertainment have also embraced AI to compose \nmusic, create stage performances, and even to generate 3D scenes from natural \nlanguage text. The enthusiasm with which people have already responded to AI-driven  \nentertainment has been surprising. As with many aspects of  AI, there is ongoing debate \nabout the extent to which the technology replaces or enhances sociability . AI will \nincreasingly enable entertainment that is more interactive, personalized, and engaging. \nResearch should be directed toward understanding how to leverage these attributes \nfor individuals’ and society’s benefit. \nWhat’s next for AI research?\nThe research that fuels the AI revolution has also seen rapid changes. Foremost \namong them is the maturation of  machine learning, stimulated in part by the rise of  \nthe digital economy , which both provides and leverages large amounts of  data. Other \nfactors include the rise of  cloud computing resources and consumer demand for \nwidespread access to services such as speech recognition and navigation support.\nMachine learning has been propelled dramatically forward by impressive \nempirical successes of  artificial neural networks, which can now be trained with huge \ndata sets and large-scale computing. This approach has been come to be known as \n“deep learning.” The leap in the performance of  information processing algorithms \nhas been accompanied by significant progress in hardware technology for basic \noperations such as sensing, perception, and object recognition. New platforms and \nLonger term, AI may be \nthought of as a radically \ndifferent mechanism \nfor wealth creation in \nwhich everyone should \nbe entitled to a portion of \nthe world’s AI-produced \ntreasures.\n\n9\nmarkets for data-driven products, and the economic incentives to find new products \nand markets, have also stimulated research advances. Now , as it becomes a central \nforce in society , the field of  AI is shifting toward building intelligent systems that \ncan collaborate effectively with people, and that are more generally human-aware, \nincluding creative ways to develop interactive and scalable ways for people to \nteach robots. These trends drive the currently “hot” areas of  AI research into both \nfundamental methods and application areas:\nLarge-scale machine learning concerns the design of  learning algorithms, as \nwell as scaling existing algorithms, to work with extremely large data sets.\nDeep learning, a class of  learning procedures, has facilitated object recognition \nin images, video labeling, and activity recognition, and is making significant inroads into \nother areas of  perception, such as audio, speech, and natural language processing.\nReinforcement learning is a framework that shifts the focus of  machine \nlearning from pattern recognition to experience-driven sequential decision-making. \nIt promises to carry AI applications forward toward taking actions in the real world. \nWhile largely confined to academia over the past several decades, it is now seeing \nsome practical, real-world successes.\nRobotics is currently concerned with how to train a robot to interact with the \nworld around it in generalizable and predictable ways, how to facilitate manipulation \nof  objects in interactive environments, and how to interact with people. Advances in \nrobotics will rely on commensurate advances to improve the reliability and generality \nof  computer vision and other forms of  machine perception.\nComputer vision is currently the most prominent form of  machine perception. \nIt has been the sub-area of  AI most transformed by the rise of  deep learning. For the \nfirst time, computers are able to perform some vision tasks better than people. Much \ncurrent research is focused on automatic image and video captioning.\nNatural Language Processing, often coupled with automatic speech recognition, \nis quickly becoming a commodity for widely spoken languages with large data sets. \nResearch is now shifting to develop refined and capable systems that are able to \ninteract with people through dialog, not just react to stylized requests. Great strides \nhave also been made in machine translation among different languages, with more \nreal-time person-to-person exchanges on the near horizon.\nCollaborative systems research investigates models and algorithms to help develop \nautonomous systems that can work collaboratively with other systems and with humans.\nCrowdsourcing and human computation research investigates methods to \naugment computer systems by making automated calls to human expertise to solve \nproblems that computers alone cannot solve well. \nAlgorithmic game theory and computational social choice draw attention \nto the economic and social computing dimensions of  AI, such as how systems can \nhandle potentially misaligned incentives, including self-interested human participants \nor firms and the automated AI-based agents representing them.\nInternet of  Things (IoT) research is devoted to the idea that a wide array of  \ndevices, including appliances, vehicles, buildings, and cameras, can be interconnected to \ncollect and share their abundant sensory information to use for intelligent purposes.\nNeuromorphic computing is a set of  technologies that seek to mimic \nbiological neural networks to improve the hardware efficiency and robustness of  \ncomputing systems, often replacing an older emphasis on separate modules for input/\noutput, instruction-processing, and memory .\nThe field of AI is shifting \ntoward building intelligent \nsystems that can \ncollaborate effectively with \npeople, including creative \nways to develop interactive \nand scalable ways for \npeople to teach robots.\n\n10\nAI policy, now and in the future\nThe measure of  success for AI applications is the value they create for human lives. \nIn that light, they should be designed to enable people to understand AI systems \nsuccessfully , participate in their use, and build their trust. Public policies should help \nease society’s adaptation to AI applications, extend their benefits, and mitigate their \ninevitable errors and failures. Debate about how AI is deployed, including concerns \nabout how privacy is protected and AI’s benefits fairly shared, should be encouraged. \nGiven the speed with which AI technologies are being realized, and concomitant \nconcerns about their implications, the Study Panel recommends that all layers of  \ngovernment acquire technical expertise in AI. Further, research on the fairness, \nsecurity , privacy , and societal implications of  AI systems should be encouraged by \nremoving impediments and increasing private and public spending to support it.\nCurrently in the United States, at least sixteen separate agencies govern sectors \nof  the economy related to AI technologies. Rapid advances in AI research and, \nespecially , its applications require experts in these sectors to develop new concepts \nand metaphors for law and policy . Who is responsible when a self-driven car crashes \nor an intelligent medical device fails? How can AI applications be prevented from \npromulgating racial discrimination or financial cheating? Who should reap the gains \nof  efficiencies enabled by AI technologies and what protections should be afforded \nto people whose skills are rendered obsolete? As people integrate AI more broadly \nand deeply into industrial processes and consumer products, best practices need to be \nspread, and regulatory regimes adapted.\nWhile the Study Panel does not consider it likely that near-term AI systems will \nautonomously choose to inflict harm on people, it will be possible for people to use  \nAI-based systems for harmful as well as helpful purposes. And though AI algorithms \nmay be capable of  making less biased decisions than a typical person, it remains \na deep technical challenge to ensure that the data that inform AI-based decisions \ncan be kept free from biases that could lead to discrimination based on race, sexual \norientation, or other factors.\nFaced with the profound changes that AI technologies can produce, pressure for \n“more” and “tougher” regulation is probably inevitable. Misunderstandings about \nwhat AI is and is not could fuel opposition to technologies with the potential to \nbenefit everyone. Inappropriate regulatory activity would be a tragic mistake. Poorly \ninformed regulation that stifles innovation, or relocates it to other jurisdictions, would \nbe counterproductive.2\nFortunately , principles that guide successful regulation of  current digital technologies \nprovide a starting point. In privacy regulation, broad legal mandates coupled with \ntough transparency requirements and meaningful enforcement—rather than strict \ncontrols—encourage companies to develop processes and professional staff to \nenforce privacy controls, engage with outside stakeholders, and adapt their practices \nto technological advances. This in turn supports the development of  professional \ntrade associations and standards committees that spread best practices. In AI, too, \nregulators can strengthen a virtuous cycle of  activity involving internal and external \naccountability , transparency , and professionalization, rather than narrow compliance.\nA vigorous and informed debate about how to best steer AI in ways that enrich \nour lives and our society , while encouraging creativity in the field, is an urgent and \nvital need. AI technologies could widen existing inequalities of  opportunity if  access \nto them—along with the high-powered computation and large-scale data that fuel \nmany of  them—is unfairly distributed across society . These technologies will improve \n2  Kate Crawford, “ Artificial Intelligence’s White Guy Problem,” The New Y ork Times, June 25, \n2016, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-\nintelligences-white-guy-problem.html.\nMisunderstandings \nabout what AI is and is \nnot could fuel opposition \nto technologies with \nthe potential to benefit \neveryone.

Policies should be \nevaluated as to whether they foster democratic values and equitable sharing of  AI’s \nbenefits, or concentrate power and benefits in the hands of  a fortunate few .\nAs this report documents, significant AI-related advances have already had \nan impact on North American cities over the past fifteen years, and even more \nsubstantial developments will occur over the next fifteen. Recent advances are largely \ndue to the growth and analysis of  large data sets enabled by the internet, advances \nin sensory technologies and, more recently , applications of  “deep learning.” In the \ncoming years, as the public encounters new AI applications in domains such as \ntransportation and healthcare, they must be introduced in ways that build trust and \nunderstanding, and respect human and civil rights. While encouraging innovation, \npolicies and processes should address ethical, privacy , and security implications, and \nshould work to ensure that the benefits of  AI technologies will be spread broadly and \nfairly . Doing so will be critical if  Artificial Intelligence research and its applications \nare to exert a positive influence on North American urban life in 2030 and beyond.\n\n12\nSECTION I: WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL \nINTELLIGENCE?\nThis section describes how researchers and practitioners define “ Artificial Intelligence,” and \nthe areas of  AI research and application that are currently thriving. It proffers definitions of  \nwhat AI is and is not, and describes some of  the currently “hot” areas of  AI Research. This \nsection lays the groundwork for Section II, which elaborates on AI’s impacts and future in \neight domains and Section III, which describes issues related to AI design and public policy \nand makes recommendations for encouraging AI innovation while protecting democratic values.\nDEFINING AI\nCuriously , the lack of  a precise, universally accepted definition of  AI probably \nhas helped the field to grow , blossom, and advance at an ever-accelerating pace. \nPractitioners, researchers, and developers of  AI are instead guided by a rough \nsense of  direction and an imperative to “get on with it.” Still, a definition remains \nimportant and Nils J. Nilsson has provided a useful one:\n“ Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and \nintelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with \nforesight in its environment.”3\nFrom this perspective, characterizing AI depends on the credit one is willing to \ngive synthesized software and hardware for functioning “appropriately” and with \n“foresight.” A simple electronic calculator performs calculations much faster than \nthe human brain, and almost never makes a mistake.4 Is a calculator intelligent? \nLike Nilsson, the Study Panel takes a broad view that intelligence lies on a multi-\ndimensional spectrum. According to this view , the difference between an arithmetic \ncalculator and a human brain is not one of  kind, but of  scale, speed, degree of  \nautonomy , and generality . The same factors can be used to evaluate every other \ninstance of  intelligence—speech recognition software, animal brains, cruise-control \nsystems in cars, Go-playing programs, thermostats—and to place them at some \nappropriate location in the spectrum.\nAlthough our broad interpretation places the calculator within the intelligence \nspectrum, such simple devices bear little resemblance to today’s AI. The frontier of   \nAI has moved far ahead and functions of  the calculator are only one among the  \nmillions that today’s smartphones can perform. AI developers now work on improving, \ngeneralizing, and scaling up the intelligence currently found on smartphones.\nIn fact, the field of  AI is a continual endeavor to push forward the frontier of  \nmachine intelligence. Ironically , AI suffers the perennial fate of  losing claim to its \nacquisitions, which eventually and inevitably get pulled inside the frontier, a repeating \npattern known as the “ AI effect” or the “odd paradox”—AI brings a new technology \ninto the common fold, people become accustomed to this technology , it stops being \nconsidered AI, and newer technology emerges.5 The same pattern will continue in the \nfuture. AI does not “deliver” a life-changing product as a bolt from the blue. Rather, \nAI technologies continue to get better in a continual, incremental way .\n3  Nils J.

(Natick, MA: A. K. Peters, Ltd., 2004; San Francisco: W . H. Freeman, \n1979), Citations are to the Peters edition.\nAn accurate and \nsophisticated picture of \nAI—one that competes with \nits popular portrayal—is \nhampered by the difficulty \nof pinning down a precise \ndefinition of artificial \nintelligence.\n\n13\nThe human measure\nNotably , the characterization of  intelligence as a spectrum grants no special status \nto the human brain. But to date human intelligence has no match in the biological \nand artificial worlds for sheer versatility , with the abilities “to reason, achieve \ngoals, understand and generate language, perceive and respond to sensory inputs, \nprove mathematical theorems, play challenging games, synthesize and summarize \ninformation, create art and music, and even write histories.”6\nThis makes human intelligence a natural choice for benchmarking the progress \nof  AI. It may even be proposed, as a rule of  thumb, that any activity computers \nare able to perform and people once performed should be counted as an instance \nof  intelligence. But matching any human ability is only a sufficient condition, not a \nnecessary one. There are already many systems that exceed human intelligence, at \nleast in speed, such as scheduling the daily arrivals and departures of  thousands of  \nflights in an airport.\nAI’s long quest—and eventual success—to beat human players at the game of  \nchess offered a high-profile instance for comparing human to machine intelligence. \nChess has fascinated people for centuries. When the possibility of  building computers \nbecame imminent, Alan Turing, who many consider the father of  computer science, \n“mentioned the idea of  computers showing intelligence with chess as a paradigm.”7 \nWithout access to powerful computers, “Turing played a game in which he simulated \nthe computer, taking about half  an hour per move.”\nBut it was only after a long line of  improvements in the sixties and seventies—\ncontributed by groups at Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, MIT , The Institute for \nTheoretical and Experimental Physics at Moscow , and Northwestern University—\nthat chess-playing programs started gaining proficiency . The final push came \nthrough a long-running project at IBM, which culminated with the Deep Blue \nprogram beating Garry Kasparov , then the world chess champion, by a score of  \n3.5-2.5 in 1997. Curiously , no sooner had AI caught up with its elusive target than \nDeep Blue was portrayed as a collection of  “brute force methods” that wasn’t “real \nintelligence.”8 In fact, IBM’s subsequent publication about Deep Blue, which gives \nextensive details about its search and evaluation procedures, doesn’t mention the \nword “intelligent” even once!9 Was Deep Blue intelligent or not? Once again, the \nfrontier had moved.\nAn operational definition\nAI can also be defined by what AI researchers do. This report views AI \nprimarily as a branch of  computer science that studies the properties of  \nintelligence by synthesizing intelligence. 10 Though the advent of  AI has depended \non the rapid progress of  hardware computing resources, the focus here on \nsoftware reflects a trend in the AI community . More recently , though, progress in \nbuilding hardware tailored for neural-network-based computing 11 has created a \n6  Nilsson, The Quest for Artificial Intelligence.\n7  Nilsson, The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, 89.\n8  McCorduck, Machines Who Think, 433.\n9  Murray Campbell, A.

According to \nthis view, the difference \nbetween an arithmetic \ncalculator and a human \nbrain is not one of kind, \nbut of scale, speed, \ndegree of autonomy, and \ngenerality.\n\n14\ntighter coupling between hardware and software in advancing AI.\n“Intelligence” remains a complex phenomenon whose varied aspects have attracted \nthe attention of  several different fields of  study , including psychology , economics, \nneuroscience, biology , engineering, statistics, and linguistics. Naturally , the field of  AI has  \nbenefited from the progress made by all of  these allied fields. For example, the artificial \nneural network, which has been at the heart of  several AI-based solutions12 13 was \noriginally inspired by thoughts about the flow of  information in biological neurons.14\nAI RESEARCH TRENDS\nUntil the turn of  the millennium, AI’s appeal lay largely in its promise to deliver, but \nin the last fifteen years, much of  that promise has been redeemed.15 AI technologies \nalready pervade our lives. As they becomes a central force in society , the field is \nshifting from simply building systems that are intelligent to building intelligent systems \nthat are human-aware and trustworthy .\nSeveral factors have fueled the AI revolution. Foremost among them is the \nmaturing of  machine learning, supported in part by cloud computing resources \nand wide-spread, web-based data gathering. Machine learning has been propelled \ndramatically forward by “deep learning,” a form of  adaptive artificial neural \nnetworks trained using a method called backpropagation.16 This leap in the \nperformance of  information processing algorithms has been accompanied by \nsignificant progress in hardware technology for basic operations such as sensing, \nperception, and object recognition. New platforms and markets for data-driven \nproducts, and the economic incentives to find new products and markets, have also \ncontributed to the advent of  AI-driven technology .\nAll these trends drive the “hot” areas of  research described below . This compilation \nis meant simply to reflect the areas that, by one metric or another, currently receive \ngreater attention than others. They are not necessarily more important or valuable \nthan other ones. Indeed, some of  the currently “hot” areas were less popular in past \nyears, and it is likely that other areas will similarly re-emerge in the future.\nLarge-scale machine learning\nMany of  the basic problems in machine learning (such as supervised and \nunsupervised learning) are well-understood. A major focus of  current efforts is to \nscale existing algorithms to work with extremely large data sets. For example, whereas \ntraditional methods could afford to make several passes over the data set, modern \nones are designed to make only a single pass; in some cases, only sublinear methods \n(those that only look at a fraction of  the data) can be admitted.\nDeep learning\nThe ability to successfully train convolutional neural networks has most benefited the \nfield of  computer vision, with applications such as object recognition, video \n12  Gerald Tesauro, “Practical Issues in Temporal Difference Learning,” Machine Learning, no. 8 \n(1992): 257–77.\n13  David Silver, Aja Huang, Chris J.

The method calculates the gradient of  a loss function with respect to all the \nweights in the network.\nHuman intelligence has \nno match in the biological \nand artificial worlds for \nsheer versatility, with \nthe abilities “to reason, \nachieve goals, understand \nand generate language... \ncreate art and music, and \neven write histories.”\n\n15\nlabeling, activity recognition, and several variants thereof. Deep learning is also making \nsignificant inroads into other areas of  perception, such as audio, speech, and natural \nlanguage processing.\nReinforcement learning\nWhereas traditional machine learning has mostly focused on pattern mining, \nreinforcement learning shifts the focus to decision making, and is a technology that \nwill help AI to advance more deeply into the realm of  learning about and executing \nactions in the real world. It has existed for several decades as a framework for \nexperience-driven sequential decision-making, but the methods have not found great \nsuccess in practice, mainly owing to issues of  representation and scaling. However, \nthe advent of  deep learning has provided reinforcement learning with a “shot in the \narm.” The recent success of  AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google \nDeepmind that beat the human Go champion in a five-game match, was due in large \npart to reinforcement learning. AlphaGo was trained by initializing an automated \nagent with a human expert database, but was subsequently refined by playing a large \nnumber of  games against itself  and applying reinforcement learning.\nRobotics\nRobotic navigation, at least in static environments, is largely solved. Current efforts \nconsider how to train a robot to interact with the world around it in generalizable \nand predictable ways. A natural requirement that arises in interactive environments \nis manipulation, another topic of  current interest. The deep learning revolution is \nonly beginning to influence robotics, in large part because it is far more difficult to \nacquire the large labeled data sets that have driven other learning-based areas of  AI. \nReinforcement learning (see above), which obviates the requirement of  labeled data, \nmay help bridge this gap but requires systems to be able to safely explore a policy \nspace without committing errors that harm the system itself  or others. Advances in \nreliable machine perception, including computer vision, force, and tactile perception, \nmuch of  which will be driven by machine learning, will continue to be key enablers to \nadvancing the capabilities of  robotics.\nComputer vision\nComputer vision is currently the most prominent form of  machine perception. It has \nbeen the sub-area of  AI most transformed by the rise of  deep learning. Until just a \nfew years ago, support vector machines were the method of  choice for most visual \nclassification tasks. But the confluence of  large-scale computing, especially on GPUs, \nthe availability of  large datasets, especially via the internet, and refinements of  neural \nnetwork algorithms has led to dramatic improvements in performance on benchmark \ntasks (e.g., classification on ImageNet17). For the first time, computers are able to \nperform some (narrowly defined) visual classification tasks better than people. Much \ncurrent research is focused on automatic image and video captioning.\nNatural Language Processing\nOften coupled with automatic speech recognition, Natural Language Processing is \nanother very active area of  machine perception. It is quickly becoming a commodity \nfor mainstream languages with large data sets. Google announced that 20% of  \ncurrent mobile queries are done by voice,18 and recent demonstrations have proven \nthe possibility of  real-time translation. Research is now shifting towards developing \nrefined and capable systems that are able to interact with people through dialog, not \njust react to stylized requests.\n17  ImageNet, Stanford Vision Lab, Stanford University , Princeton University , 2016, accessed \nAugust 1, 2016, www .image-net.org/.\n18  Greg Sterling, “Google says 20% of  mobile queries are voice searches,” Search Engine Land, \nMay 18, 2016, accessed August 1, 2016, http://searchengineland.com/google-reveals-20-percent-\nqueries-voice-queries-249917.\nAI technologies already \npervade our lives. As \nthey become a central \nforce in society, the \nfield is shifting from \nsimply building systems \nthat are intelligent to \nbuilding intelligent \nsystems that are \nhuman-aware and \ntrustworthy.\n\n16\nCollaborative systems\nResearch on collaborative systems investigates models and algorithms to help \ndevelop autonomous systems that can work collaboratively with other systems and \nwith humans. This research relies on developing formal models of  collaboration, \nand studies the capabilities needed for systems to become effective partners. There \nis growing interest in applications that can utilize the complementary strengths of  \nhumans and machines—for humans to help AI systems to overcome their limitations, \nand for agents to augment human abilities and activities.\nCrowdsourcing and human computation\nSince human abilities are superior to automated methods for accomplishing many \ntasks, research on crowdsourcing and human computation investigates methods to  \naugment computer systems by utilizing human intelligence to solve problems that  \ncomputers alone cannot solve well. Introduced only about fifteen years ago, this \nresearch now has an established presence in AI. The best-known example of  \ncrowdsourcing is Wikipedia, a knowledge repository that is maintained and updated \nby netizens and that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such \nas encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth. Crowdsourcing focuses on \ndevising innovative ways to harness human intelligence. Citizen science platforms \nenergize volunteers to solve scientific problems, while paid crowdsourcing platforms \nsuch as Amazon Mechanical Turk provide automated access to human intelligence on \ndemand. Work in this area has facilitated advances in other subfields of  AI, including \ncomputer vision and NLP , by enabling large amounts of  labeled training data and/or \nhuman interaction data to be collected in a short amount of  time. Current research \nefforts explore ideal divisions of  tasks between humans and machines based on their \ndiffering capabilities and costs. \nAlgorithmic game theory and computational social choice\nNew attention is being drawn to the economic and social computing dimensions of  \nAI, including incentive structures. Distributed AI and multi-agent systems have been \nstudied since the early 1980s, gained prominence starting in the late 1990s, and were \naccelerated by the internet. A natural requirement is that systems handle potentially \nmisaligned incentives, including self-interested human participants or firms, as well \nas automated AI-based agents representing them. Topics receiving attention include \ncomputational mechanism design (an economic theory of  incentive design, seeking \nincentive-compatible systems where inputs are truthfully reported), computational \nsocial choice (a theory for how to aggregate rank orders on alternatives), incentive \naligned information elicitation (prediction markets, scoring rules, peer prediction) and \nalgorithmic game theory (the equilibria of  markets, network games, and parlor games \nsuch as Poker—a game where significant advances have been made in recent years \nthrough abstraction techniques and no-regret learning).\nInternet of Things (IoT)\nA growing body of  research is devoted to the idea that a wide array of  devices can \nbe interconnected to collect and share their sensory information. Such devices can \ninclude appliances, vehicles, buildings, cameras, and other things. While it’s a matter \nof  technology and wireless networking to connect the devices, AI can process and \nuse the resulting huge amounts of  data for intelligent and useful purposes. Currently , \nthese devices use a bewildering array of  incompatible communication protocols. AI \ncould help tame this Tower of  Babel.\nNeuromorphic Computing\nTraditional computers implement the von Neumann model of  computing, which \nseparates the modules for input/output, instruction-processing, and memory . With \nthe success of  deep neural networks on a wide array of  tasks, manufacturers are \nNatural Language \nProcessing is a very \nactive area of machine \nperception. Research \nis now shifting towards \ndeveloping systems that \nare able to interact with \npeople through dialog, \nnot just react to stylized \nrequests.\n\n17\nactively pursuing alternative models of  computing—especially those that are inspired \nby what is known about biological neural networks—with the aim of  improving the \nhardware efficiency and robustness of  computing systems. At the moment, such \n“neuromorphic” computers have not yet clearly demonstrated big wins, and are just \nbeginning to become commercially viable. But it is possible that they will become \ncommonplace (even if  only as additions to their von Neumann cousins) in the \nnear future. Deep neural networks have already created a splash in the application \nlandscape. A larger wave may hit when these networks can be trained and executed \non dedicated neuromorphic hardware, as opposed to simulated on standard von \nNeumann architectures, as they are today .\nOverall trends and the future of AI research\nThe resounding success of  the data-driven paradigm has displaced the traditional \nparadigms of  AI. Procedures such as theorem proving and logic-based knowledge \nrepresentation and reasoning are receiving reduced attention, in part because of  the \nongoing challenge of  connecting with real-world groundings. Planning, which was a \nmainstay of  AI research in the seventies and eighties, has also received less attention \nof  late due in part to its strong reliance on modeling assumptions that are hard \nto satisfy in realistic applications. Model-based approaches—such as physics-based \napproaches to vision and traditional control and mapping in robotics—have by and \nlarge given way to data-driven approaches that close the loop with sensing the results \nof  actions in the task at hand. Bayesian reasoning and graphical models, which were \nvery popular even quite recently , also appear to be going out of  favor, having been \ndrowned by the deluge of  data and the remarkable success of  deep learning.\nOver the next fifteen years, the Study Panel expects an increasing focus on \ndeveloping systems that are human-aware, meaning that they specifically model, \nand are specifically designed for, the characteristics of  the people with whom they \nare meant to interact. There is a lot of  interest in trying to find new , creative ways \nto develop interactive and scalable ways to teach robots. Also, IoT-type systems— \ndevices and the cloud—are becoming increasingly popular, as is thinking about \nsocial and economic dimensions of  AI. In the coming years, new perception/object \nrecognition capabilities and robotic platforms that are human-safe will grow , as will \ndata-driven products and their markets.\nThe Study Panel also expects a reemergence of  some of  the traditional forms of  \nAI as practitioners come to realize the inevitable limitations of  purely end-to-end deep \nlearning approaches. We encourage young researchers not to reinvent the wheel,  \nbut rather to maintain an awareness of  the significant progress in many areas of   \nAI during the first fifty years of  the field, and in related fields such as control theory , \ncognitive science, and psychology .\nA growing body of research \nis devoted to the idea that \na wide array of devices \ncan be interconnected \nto collect and share their \nsensory information. \nSuch devices can include \nappliances, vehicles, \nbuildings, cameras, and \nother things.\n\n18\nSECTION II: AI BY DOMAIN\nThough different instances of  AI research and practice share common technologies, such  \nas machine learning, they also vary considerably in different sectors of  the economy and  \nsociety. We call these sectors “domains,” and in this section describe the different states  \nof  AI research and implementation, as well as impacts and distinct challenges, in eight of  \nthem: transportation; home/service robotics; healthcare; education; low-resource communities; \npublic safety and security; employment and workplace; and entertainment. Based on these \nanalyses, we also predict trends in a typical North American city over the next fifteen years. \nContrary to AI’s typical depiction in popular culture, we seek to offer a balanced overview \nof  the ways in which AI is already beginning to transform everyday life, and how those \ntransformations are likely to grow by the year 2030.\nTRANSPORTATION\nTransportation is likely to be one of  the first domains in which the general public \nwill be asked to trust the reliability and safety of  an AI system for a critical task. \nAutonomous transportation will soon be commonplace and, as most people’s first \nexperience with physically embodied AI systems, will strongly influence the public’s \nperception of  AI. Once the physical hardware is made sufficiently safe and robust, its \nintroduction to daily life may happen so suddenly as to surprise the public, which will \nrequire time to adjust. As cars will become better drivers than people, city-dwellers \nwill own fewer cars, live further from work, and spend time differently , leading to an \nentirely new urban organization. Further, in the typical North American city in 2030, \nchanges won’t be limited to cars and trucks, but are likely to include flying vehicles \nand personal robots, and will raise social, ethical and policy issues.\nA few key technologies have already catalyzed the widespread adoption of  AI \nin transportation. Compared to 2000, the scale and diversity of  data about personal \nand population-level transportation available today—enabled by the adoption of  \nsmartphones and decreased costs and improved accuracies for variety of  sensors—is \nastounding. Without the availability of  this data and connectivity , applications such as \nreal-time sensing and prediction of  traffic, route calculations, peer-to-peer ridesharing \nand self-driving cars would not be possible.\nSmarter cars\nGPS was introduced to personal vehicles in 2001 with in-car navigation devices and \nhas since become a fundamental part of  the transportation infrastructure.19 GPS \nassists drivers while providing large-scale information to technology companies and \ncities about transportation patterns. Widespread adoption of  smartphones with GPS \ntechnology further increased connectivity and the amount of  location data shared by \nindividuals.\nCurrent vehicles are also equipped with a wide range of  sensing capabilities. \nAn average automobile in the US is predicted to have seventy sensors including \ngyroscopes, accelerometers, ambient light sensors, and moisture sensors. 20 Sensors \nare not new to vehicles. Automobiles built before 2000 had sensors for the \ninternal state of  the vehicle such as its speed, acceleration, and wheel position. 21 \n19  Mark Sullivan, “ A brief  history of  GPS,” PCWorld, August 9, 2012, accessed August 1, 2016, \nhttp://www .pcworld.com/article/2000276/a-brief-history-of-gps.html.\n20  William J.

Vision and radar technology \nwere leveraged to develop pre-collision systems that let cars autonomously brake \nwhen risk of  a collision is detected. Deep learning also has been applied to improve \nautomobiles’ capacity to detect objects in the environment and recognize sound.29\nSelf-driving vehicles\nSince the 1930s, science fiction writers dreamed of  a future with self-driving cars, \nand building them has been a challenge for the AI community since the 1960s. By \nthe 2000s, the dream of  autonomous vehicles became a reality in the sea and sky , and \neven on Mars, but self-driving cars existed only as research prototypes in labs.

During the first \nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) “grand challenge” on \nautonomous driving in 2004, research teams failed to complete the challenge in a \nlimited desert setting.\nBut in eight short years, from 2004-2012, speedy and surprising progress occurred \nin both academia and industry . Advances in sensing technology and machine learning \nfor perception tasks has sped progress and, as a result, Google’s autonomous vehicles \nand Tesla’s semi-autonomous cars are driving on city streets today . Google’s self-\ndriving cars, which have logged more than 1,500,000 miles (300,000 miles without an \naccident),33 are completely autonomous—no human input needed. Tesla has widely \nreleased self-driving capability to existing cars with a software update.34 Their cars are \nsemi-autonomous, with human drivers expected to stay engaged and take over if  they \ndetect a potential problem. It is not yet clear whether this semi-autonomous approach \nis sustainable, since as people become more confident in the cars’ capabilities, they \nare likely to pay less attention to the road, and become less reliable when they are \nmost needed. The first traffic fatality involving an autonomous car, which occurred in \nJune of  2016, brought this question into sharper focus.35\nIn the near future, sensing algorithms will achieve super-human performance for \ncapabilities required for driving. Automated perception, including vision, is already \nnear or at human-level performance for well-defined tasks such as recognition and \ntracking. Advances in perception will be followed by algorithmic improvements  \nin higher level reasoning capabilities such as planning. A recent report predicts \nself-driving cars to be widely adopted by 2020.36 And the adoption of  self-driving \ncapabilities won’t be limited to personal transportation. We will see self-driving and \nremotely controlled delivery vehicles, flying vehicles, and trucks. Peer-to-peer \ntransportation services such as ridesharing are also likely to utilize self-driving vehicles. \nBeyond self-driving cars, advances in robotics will facilitate the creation and adoption \nof  other types of  autonomous vehicles, including robots and drones.\nIt is not yet clear how much better self-driving cars need to become to encourage \nbroad acceptance. The collaboration required in semi-self-driving cars and its \nimplications for the cognitive load of  human drivers is not well understood. But \nif  future self-driving cars are adopted with the predicted speed, and they exceed \nhuman-level performance in driving, other significant societal changes will follow . \nSelf-driving cars will eliminate one of  the biggest causes of  accidental death and \ninjury in United States, and lengthen people’s life expectancy .

Peer-to-peer \ntransportation services \nsuch as ridesharing are \nalso likely to utilize self-\ndriving vehicles.\n\n21\ncommuter in US spends twenty-five minutes driving each way .37 With self-driving car \ntechnology , people will have more time to work or entertain themselves during their \ncommutes. And the increased comfort and decreased cognitive load with self-driving \ncars and shared transportation may affect where people choose to live. The reduced \nneed for parking may affect the way cities and public spaces are designed. Self-driving \ncars may also serve to increase the freedom and mobility of  different subgroups of  \nthe population, including youth, elderly and disabled.\nSelf-driving cars and peer-to-peer transportation services may eliminate the need  \nto own a vehicle. The effect on total car use is hard to predict. Trips of  empty vehicles \nand people’s increased willingness to travel may lead to more total miles driven. \nAlternatively , shared autonomous vehicles—people using cars as a service rather than  \nowning their own—may reduce total miles, especially if  combined with well-constructed \nincentives, such as tolls or discounts, to spread out travel demand, share trips, and \nreduce congestion. The availability of  shared transportation may displace the need \nfor public transportation—or public transportation may change form towards \npersonal rapid transit, already available in four cities,38 which uses small capacity \nvehicles to transport people on demand and point-to-point between many stations.39\nAs autonomous vehicles become more widespread, questions will arise over their \nsecurity , including how to ensure that technologies are safe and properly tested \nunder different road conditions prior to their release. Autonomous vehicles and the \nconnected transportation infrastructure will create a new venue for hackers to exploit \nvulnerabilities to attack. Ethical questions are also involved in programming cars to \nact in situations in which human injury or death is inevitable, especially when there \nare split-second choices to be made about whom to put at risk. The legal systems in \nmost states in the US do not have rules covering self-driving cars. As of  2016, four \nstates in the US (Nevada, Florida, California, and Michigan), Ontario in Canada, \nthe United Kingdom, France, and Switzerland have passed rules for the testing \nof  self-driving cars on public roads. Even these laws do not address issues about \nresponsibility and assignment of  blame for an accident for self-driving and semi-self-\ndriving cars.40\nTransportation planning\nBy 2005, cities had started investing in the transportation infrastructure to develop \nsensing capabilities for vehicle and pedestrian traffic.41 The sensors currently used \ninclude inductive loops, video cameras, remote traffic microwave sensors, radars, and \nGPS.42 For example, in 2013 New Y ork started using a combination of  microwave \nsensors, a network of  cameras, and pass readers to detect vehicle traffic in the city .43\n37  Brian McKenzie and Melanie Rapino, “Commuting in the United States: 2009,” American \nCommunity Survey Reports, United States Census Bureau, September 2011, accessed August 1, 2016, \nhttps://www .census.gov/prod/2011pubs/acs-15.pdf.\n38  Morgantown, West Virginia; Masdar City , UAE; London, England; and Suncheon, South \nKorea.\n39  “Personal rapid transit,” Wikipedia, Last modified July 18, 2016, accessed August 1, 2016, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_rapid_transit.\n40  Patrick Lin, “The Ethics of  Autonomous Cars,” The Atlantic, October 8, 2013, accessed \nAugust 1, 2016, http://www .theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-ethics-of-\nautonomous-cars/280360/.\n41  Steve Lohr, “Bringing Efficiency to the Infrastructure,” The New Y ork Times, April 29, \n2009, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .nytimes.com/2009/04/30/business/energy-\nenvironment/30smart.html.\n42  “Intelligent transportation system,” Wikipedia, last modified July 28, 2016, accessed August 1, 2016,  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_transportation_system.\n43  Access Science Editors, “ Active traffic management: adaptive traffic signal control,” Access Science, \n2014, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .accessscience.com/content/active-traffic-management-\nadaptive-traffic-signal-control/BR0106141.\nShared transportation \nmay displace the need for \npublic transportation—\nor public transportation \nmay change form towards \npersonal rapid transit  \nthat uses small capacity \nvehicles to transport \npeople on demand.\n\n22\nCities use AI methods to optimize services in several ways, such as bus and subway \nschedules, and tracking traffic conditions to dynamically adjust speed limits or apply \nsmart pricing on highways, bridges, and HOV lanes.44 45 46 Using sensors and cameras \nin the road network, they can also optimize traffic light timing for improving traffic \nflow and to help with automated enforcement.47 48 These dynamic strategies are aimed \nat better utilizing the limited resources in the transportation network, and are made \npossible by the availability of  data and the widespread connectivity of  individuals.\nBefore the 2000s, transportation planners were forced to rely on static pricing \nstrategies tied to particular days or times of  day , to manage demand. As dynamic \npricing strategies are adopted, this raises new issues concerning the fair distribution \nof  public goods, since market conditions in high-demand situations may make \nservices unavailable to segments of  the public.\nThe availability of  large-scale data has also made transportation an ideal domain \nfor machine learning applications. Since 2006, applications such as Mapquest, Google \nMaps, and Bing Maps have been widely used by the public for routing trips, using public \ntransportation, receiving real-time information and predictions about traffic conditions, \n49 50 and finding services around a location.51 52 Optimal search algorithms have been \napplied to the routing of  vehicles and pedestrians to a given destination (i.e.,53 54).\nDespite these advances, the widespread application of  sensing and optimization \ntechniques to city infrastructure has been slower than the application of  these \ntechniques to individual vehicles or people. Although individual cities have \nimplemented sensing and optimization applications, as yet there is no standardization \nof  the sensing infrastructure and AI techniques used. Infrastructure costs, differing \npriorities among cities, and the high coordination costs among the parties involved \nhave slowed adoption, as have public concerns over privacy related to sensing.

Accurate predictive \nmodels of  individuals’ movements, their preferences, and their goals are likely to \nemerge with the greater availability of  data. The ethical issues regarding such an \nemergence are discussed in Section III of  this report.\nThe United States Department of  Transportation released a call for proposals in  \n2016 asking medium-size cities to imagine smart city infrastructure for transportation.55 \nThis initiative plans to award forty million dollars to a city to demonstrate how \ntechnology and data can be used to reimagine the movement of  people as well as goods.\nOne vision is a network of  connected vehicles that can reach a high level of  safety \nin driving with car-to-car communication.56 If  this vision becomes reality , we expect \nadvances in multi-agent coordination, collaboration, and planning will have a \nsignificant impact on future cars and play a role in making the transportation system \nmore reliable and efficient. Robots are also likely to take part in transportation by \ncarrying individuals and packages (c.f., Segway robot). For transportation of  goods, \ninterest in drones has increased, and Amazon is currently testing a delivery system using \nthem,57 although questions remain about the appropriate safety rules and regulations. \nThe increased sensing capabilities, adoption of  drones, and the connected \ntransportation infrastructure will also raise concerns about the privacy of  individuals \nand the safety of  private data. In coming years, these and related transportation issues \nwill need to be addressed either by preemptive action on the part of  industry or within \nthe legal framework. As noted in the Section III policy discussion, how well this is done \nwill affect the pace and scope of  AI-related advances in the transportation sector.\nOn-demand transportation\nOn-demand transportation services such as Uber and Lyft have emerged as another \npivotal application of  sensing, connectivity , and AI,58 with algorithms for matching \ndrivers to passengers by location and suitability (reputation modeling).59 60\nThrough dynamic pricing, these services ration access by willingness-to-pay , with \ndynamic pricing also encouraging an increase in the supply of  drivers, and have \nbecome a popular method for transportation in cities. With their rapid advance have \ncome multiple policy and legal issues, such as competition with existing taxi services \nand concerns about lack of  regulation and safety . On-demand transportation services \nseem likely to be a major force towards self-driving cars.\nCarpooling and ridesharing have long been seen as a promising approach to \ndecrease traffic congestion and better utilize personal transportation resources. \nServices such as Zimride and Nuride bring together people sharing similar routes for a \njoint trip. But this approach to carpooling has failed to gain traction on a large scale.\n55  “U.S. Department of  Transportation Launches Smart City Challenge to Create a City of  \nthe Future,” Transportation.gov , U.S. Department of  Transportation, December 7, 2015, accessed \nAugust 1, 2016, https://www .transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-\nlaunches-smart-city-challenge-create-city-future.\n56  Will Knight, “Car-to-Car Communication: A simple wireless technology promises to \nmake driving much safer.,” MIT T echnology Review, accessed August 1, 2016, https://www .\ntechnologyreview .com/s/534981/car-to-car-communication/.\n57  “ Amazon Prime Air,” Amazon, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .amazon.com/\nb?node=8037720011.\n58  Jared Meyer, “Uber and Lyft are changing the way Americans move about their country ,” \nNational Review, June 7, 2016, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .nationalreview .com/\narticle/436263/uber-lyft-ride-sharing-services-sharing-economy-are-future.\n59  Alexander Howard, “How Digital Platforms Like LinkedIn, Uber And TaskRabbit Are \nChanging The On-Demand Economy ,” The Huffington Post, July 14, 2015, accessed August 1, 2016, \nhttp://www .huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-talent-platforms_us_55a03545e4b0b8145f72ccf6.\n60  “ Announcing UberPool,” Uber Newsroom, August 5, 2014, accessed August 1, 2016, https://\nnewsroom.uber.com/announcing-uberpool/.\nOur Study Panel doesn’t \nexpect drones that can \nfly, swim, and drive, or \nflying quadcoptors to \nbecome a common means \nof transportation by 2030 \n(although prototypes exist \ntoday).\n\n24\nInteracting with people\nFor decades, people have imagined wildly different, futuristic-looking transportation \nvehicles. Although future cars will be smarter and drones will be available widely , it \nis unlikely that by 2030 we will have widely adopted transportation vehicles that look \nand function differently than the ones we have today . Our Study Panel doesn’t expect \ndrones that can fly , swim, and drive, or flying quadcoptors to become a common \nmeans of  transportation in this time horizon (although prototypes exist today).\nWe do expect humans to become partners to self-driving cars and drones in their \ntraining, execution, and evaluation. This partnering will happen both when humans \nare co-located with machines and also virtually . We predict advances in algorithms to \nfacilitate machine learning from human input. We also expect models and algorithms \nfor modeling of  human attention, and to support communication and coordination \nbetween humans and machine. This is an integral part of  the development of   \nfuture vehicles.\nHOME/SERVICE ROBOTS\nRobots have entered people’s homes in the past fifteen years. Disappointingly slow \ngrowth in the diversity of  applications has occurred simultaneously with increasingly \nsophisticated AI deployed on existing applications. AI advances are often inspired by \nmechanical innovations, which in turn prompt new AI techniques to be introduced.\nOver the next fifteen years, coincident advances in mechanical and AI technologies \npromise to increase the safe and reliable use and utility of  home robots in a typical \nNorth American city . Special purpose robots will deliver packages, clean offices,  \nand enhance security , but technical constraints and the high costs of  reliable \nmechanical devices will continue to limit commercial opportunities to narrowly \ndefined applications for the foreseeable future. As with self-driving cars and other  \nnew transportation machines, the difficulty of  creating reliable, market-ready \nhardware is not to be underestimated.\nVacuum cleaners\nIn 2001, after many years of  development, the Electrolux Trilobite, a vacuum \ncleaning robot, became the first commercial home robot. It had a simple control \nsystem to do obstacle avoidance, and some navigation. A year later, iRobot introduced \nRoomba, which was a tenth the price of  the Trilobite and, with only 512 bytes of  \nRAM, ran a behavior based controller. The most intelligent thing it did was to avoid \nfalling down stairs. Since then, sixteen million Roombas have been deployed all over \nthe world and several other competing brands now exist.\nAs the processing power and RAM capacity of  low cost embedded processors \nimproved from its dismal state in the year 2000, the AI capabilities of  these robots \nalso improved dramatically . Simple navigation, self-charging, and actions for dealing \nwith full dust bins were added, followed by ability to deal with electrical cords and \nrug tassels, enabled by a combination of  mechanical improvements and sensor \nbased perception. More recently , the addition of  full VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous \nLocation and Mapping)— an AI technology that had been around for twenty years—\nhas enabled the robots to build a complete 3D world model of  a house as they clean, \nand become more efficient in their cleaning coverage.\nEarly expectations that many new applications would be found for home robots have \nnot materialized. Robot vacuum cleaners are restricted to localized flat areas, while real \nhomes have lots of  single steps, and often staircases; there has been very little research \non robot mobility inside real homes. Hardware platforms remain challenging to build, \nand there are few applications that people want enough to buy . Perceptual algorithms \nOver the next fifteen years, \ncoincident advances \nin mechanical and AI \ntechnologies promise to \nincrease the safe and \nreliable use and utility of \nhome robots in a typical \nNorth American city.\n\n25\nfor functions such as image labeling, and 3D object recognition, while common at AI \nconferences, are still only a few years into development as products.\nHome robots 2030\nDespite the slow growth to date of  robots in the home, there are signs that this will \nchange in the next fifteen years. Corporations such as Amazon Robotics and Uber \nare developing large economies of  scale using various aggregation technologies. Also:\nSystem in Module (SiM), with a lot of  System on Chip (SoC) subsystems, are \nnow being pushed out the door by phone-chip makers (Qualcomm’s SnapDragon, \nSamsung’s Artik, etc.). These are better than supercomputers of  less than ten years \nago with eight or more sixty-four-bit cores, and specialized silicon for cryptography , \ncamera drivers, additional DSPs, and hard silicon for certain perceptual algorithms. \nThis means that low cost devices will be able to support much more onboard AI than \nwe have been able to consider over the last fifteen years.\nCloud (“someone else’s computer”) is going to enable more rapid release of  new \nsoftware on home robots, and more sharing of  data sets gathered in many different \nhomes, which will in turn feed cloud-based machine learning, and then power \nimprovements to already deployed robots.\nThe great advances in speech understanding and image labeling enabled by deep \nlearning will enhance robots’ interactions with people in their homes.\nLow cost 3D sensors, driven by gaming platforms, have fueled work on 3D \nperception algorithms by thousands of  researchers worldwide, which will speed the \ndevelopment and adoption of  home and service robots.\nIn the past three years, low cost and safe robot arms have been introduced to \nhundreds of  research labs around the world, sparking a new class of  research on \nmanipulation that will eventually be applicable in the home, perhaps around 2025. \nMore than half  a dozen startups around the world are developing AI-based robots for \nthe home, for now concentrating mainly on social interaction. New ethics and privacy \nissues may surface as a result.\nHEALTHCARE\nFor AI technologies, healthcare has long been viewed as a promising domain.  \nAI-based applications could improve health outcomes and quality of  life for  \nmillions of  people in the coming years—but only if  they gain the trust of  doctors, \nnurses, and patients, and if  policy , regulatory , and commercial obstacles are removed. \nPrime applications include clinical decision support, patient monitoring and \ncoaching, automated devices to assist in surgery or patient care, and management  \nof  healthcare systems. Recent successes, such as mining social media to infer  \npossible health risks, machine learning to predict patients at risk, and robotics \nto support surgery , have expanded a sense of  possibility for AI in healthcare. \nImprovements in methods for interacting with medical professionals and patients  \nwill be a critical challenge.\nAs in other domains, data is a key enabler. There has been an immense forward \nleap in collecting useful data from personal monitoring devices and mobile apps, from \nelectronic health records (EHR) in clinical settings and, to a lesser extent, from robots \ndesigned to assist with medical procedures and hospital operations. But using this \ndata to enable more finely-grained diagnostics and treatments for both individual \npatients and patient populations has proved difficult. Research and deployment have \nbeen slowed by outdated regulations and incentive structures. Poor human-computer \ninteraction methods and the inherent difficulties and risks of  implementing \ntechnologies in such a large and complex system have slowed realization of  AI’s \nSpecial purpose robots \nwill deliver packages, \nclean offices, and enhance \nsecurity, but technical \nconstraints and high \ncosts will continue to limit \ncommercial opportunities \nfor the foreseeable future.\n\n26\npromise in healthcare.61 The reduction or removal of  these obstacles, combined with \ninnovations still on the horizon, have the potential to significantly improve health \noutcomes and quality of  life for millions of  people in the coming years.\nThe clinical setting\nFor decades, the vision of  an AI-powered clinician’s assistant has been a near cliché. \nAlthough there have been successful pilots of  AI-related technology in healthcare,62 \nthe current healthcare delivery system unfortunately remains structurally ill-suited to \nabsorb and deploy rapid advances. Incentives provided by the Affordable Care Act \nhave accelerated the penetration of  electronic health records (EHRs) into clinical \npractice, but implementation has been poor, eroding clinicians’ confidence in their \nusefulness. A small group of  companies control the EHR market, and user interfaces \nare widely considered substandard, including annoying pop-ups that physicians \nroutinely dismiss. The promise of  new analytics using data from EHRs, including AI, \nremains largely unrealized due to these and other regulatory and structural barriers.\nLooking ahead to the next fifteen years, AI advances, if  coupled with sufficient data  \nand well-targeted systems, promise to change the cognitive tasks assigned to human \nclinicians. Physicians now routinely solicit verbal descriptions of  symptoms from \npresenting patients and, in their heads, correlate patterns against the clinical \npresentation of  known diseases. With automated assistance, the physician could \ninstead supervise this process, applying her or his experience and intuition to guide the \ninput process and to evaluate the output of  the machine intelligence. The literal \n“hands-on” experience of  the physician will remain critical. A significant challenge is to \noptimally integrate the human dimensions of  care with automated reasoning processes.\nTo achieve future advances, clinicians must be involved and engaged at the outset to \nensure that systems are well-engineered and trusted. Already , a new generation of  more \ntech savvy physicians routinely utilize specialized apps on mobile devices. At the same \ntime, workloads on primary care clinicians have increased to the point that they are  \ngrateful for help from any quarter. Thus, the opportunity to exploit new learning methods,  \nto create structured patterns of  inference by mining the scientific literature automatically ,  \nand to create true cognitive assistants by supporting free-form dialogue, has never \nbeen greater. Provided these advances are not stymied by regulatory , legal, and social \nbarriers, immense improvements to the value of  healthcare are within our grasp.\nHealthcare analytics\nAt the population level, AI’s ability to mine outcomes from millions of  patient clinical \nrecords promises to enable finer-grained, more personalized diagnosis and treatment. \nAutomated discovery of  genotype-phenotype connections will also become possible \nas full, once-in-a-lifetime genome sequencing becomes routine for each patient.\nA related (and perhaps earlier) capability will be to find “patients like mine” as a way  \nto inform treatment decisions based on analysis of  a similar cohort. Traditional and  \nnon-traditional healthcare data, augmented by social platforms, may lead to the emergence \nof  self-defined subpopulations, each managed by a surrounding ecosystem of  healthcare \nproviders augmented with automated recommendation and monitoring systems.\nThese developments have the potential to radically transform healthcare \n61  LeighAnne Olsen, Dara Aisner, and J.

Similarly , the automated capture of  personal \nenvironmental data from wearable devices will expand personalized medicine. These \nactivities are becoming more commercially viable as vendors discover ways to engage \nlarge populations (e.g. ShareCare)63 and then to create population-scale data that can \nbe mined to produce individualized analytics and recommendations.\nUnfortunately , the FDA has been slow to approve innovative diagnostic software, \nand there are many remaining barriers to rapid innovation. HIPAA (Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act) requirements for protecting patient privacy create  \nlegal barriers to the flow of  patient data to applications that could utilize AI technologies. \nUnanticipated negative effects of  approved drugs could show up routinely , sooner, and \nmore rigorously than they do today , but mobile apps that analyze drug interactions \nmay be blocked from pulling the necessary information from patient records. More \ngenerally , AI research and innovation in healthcare are hampered by the lack of  \nwidely accepted methods and standards for privacy protection. The FDA has been \nslow to approve innovative software, in part due to an unclear understanding of  the \ncost/benefit tradeoffs of  these systems. If  regulators (principally the FDA) recognize \nthat effective post-marketing reporting is a dependable hedge against some safety risks, \nfaster initial approval of  new treatments and interventions may become possible.\nAutomated image interpretation has also been a promising subject of  study for \ndecades. Progress on interpreting large archives of  weakly-labeled images, such as \nlarge photo archives scraped from the web, has been explosive. At first blush, it is \nsurprising that there has not been a similar revolution in interpretation of  medical \nimages. Most medical imaging modalities (CT , MR, ultrasound) are inherently digital, \nthe images are all archived, and there are large, established companies with internal \nR&D (e.g. Siemens, Philips, GE) devoted to imaging.\nBut several barriers have limited progress to date. Most hospital image archives \nhave only gone digital over the past decade. More importantly , the problem in \nmedicine is not to recognize what is in the image (is this a liver or a kidney?), but \nrather to make a fine-grained judgement about it (does the slightly darker smudge \nin the liver suggest a potentially cancerous tumor?). Strict regulations govern these \nhigh-stakes judgements. Even with state-of-the-art technologies, a radiologist will still \nlikely have to look at the images, so the value proposition is not yet compelling. Also, \nhealthcare regulations preclude easy federation of  data across institutions. Thus, only \nvery large organizations of  integrated care, such as Kaiser Permanente, are able to \nattack these problems.\nStill, automated/augmented image interpretation has started to gain momentum. \nThe next fifteen years will probably not bring fully automated radiology , but initial forays \ninto image “triage” or second level checking will likely improve the speed and cost-\neffectiveness of  medical imaging. When coupled with electronic patient record systems, \nlarge-scale machine learning techniques could be applied to medical image data. For \nexample, multiple major healthcare systems have archives of  millions of  patient scans, \neach of  which has an associated radiological report, and most have an associated \npatient record. Already , papers are appearing in the literature showing that deep neural \nnetworks can be trained to produce basic radiological findings, with high reliability ,  \nby training from this data.64\n63  Sharecare, accessed August 1, 2016, https://www.sharecare.com.\n64  Hoo-Chang Shin, Holger R.

One company \ncalled Robodoc,65 a spin-out from IBM, developed robotic systems for orthopedic \nsurgeries, such as hip and knee replacements. The technology worked, but the \ncompany struggled commercially , and was ultimately shut down and acquired for \nits technology .66 More recently , though, the research and practical use of  surgical \nrobotics has exploded.\nIn 2000 Intuitive Surgical67 introduced the da Vinci system, a novel technology \ninitially marketed to support minimally invasive heart bypass surgery , and then gained \nsubstantial market traction for treatment of  prostate cancer and merged with its \nonly major competition, Computer Motion, in 2003. The da Vinci, now in its fourth \ngeneration, provides 3D visualization (as opposed to 2D monocular laparoscopy) and \nwristed instruments in an ergonomic platform. It is considered the standard of  care  \nin multiple laparoscopic procedures, and used in nearly three quarters of  a million \nprocedures a year,68 providing not only a physical platform, but also a new data \nplatform for studying the process of  surgery .\nThe da Vinci anticipates a day when much greater insight into how medical \nprofessionals carry out the process of  providing interventional medical care will \nbe possible. The presence of  the da Vinci in day-to-day operation has also opened \nthe doors to new types of  innovation—from new instrumentation to image fusion \nto novel biomarkers—creating its own innovation ecosystem. The success of  the \nplatform has inspired potential competitors in robotic surgery , most notably the \nAlphabet spin-off V erb, in collaboration with J&J/Ethicon.69 There are likely to be \nmany more, each exploring a unique niche or space and building out an ecosystem of  \nsensing, data analytics, augmentation, and automation.\nIntelligent automation in hospital operations has been less successful. The story \nis not unlike surgical robotics. Twenty years ago, one company , HelpMate, created \na robot for hospital deliveries,70 such as meals and medical records, but ultimately \nwent bankrupt. More recently , Aethon71 introduced TUG Robots for basic deliveries, \nbut few hospitals have invested in this technology to date. However, robotics in \nother service industries such as hotels and warehouses, including Amazon Robotics \n(formerly Kiva), are demonstrating that these technologies are practical and cost \neffective in at least some large-scale settings, and may ultimately spur additional \ninnovation in health care.\nLooking ahead, many tasks that appear in healthcare will be amenable to \naugmentation, but will not be fully automated. For example, robots may be able to \ndeliver goods to the right room in a hospital, but then require a person to pick them \nup and place them in their final location.

Strict \nregulations govern these \nhigh-stakes judgements.\n\n29\nbe relatively simple once a patient is standing in a walker (though will certainly not \nbe trivial for patients recovering from surgery and/or elderly patients, especially in \ncorridors crowded with equipment and other people). Driving a needle to place a \nsuture is relatively straightforward once the needle is correctly placed.72 This implies \nthat many future systems will involve intimate interaction between people and \nmachines and require technologies that facilitate collaboration between them.\nThe growth of  automation will enable new insights into healthcare processes. \nHistorically , robotics has not been a strongly data-driven or data-oriented science. \nThis is changing as (semi)automation infiltrates healthcare. As the new surgical, \ndelivery , and patient care platforms come online, the beginnings of  quantification \nand predictive analytics are being built on top of  data coming from these platforms.73 \nThis data will be used to assess quality of  performance, identify deficiencies, errors, \nor potential optimizations, and will be used as feedback to improve performance. In \nshort, these platforms will facilitate making the connection between what is done, and \nthe outcome achieved, making true “closed-loop” medicine a real possibility .\nMobile health\nTo date, evidence-driven analytics on healthcare have relied on traditional healthcare \ndata—mainly the electronic medical records discussed above. In the clinical setting, \nthere are hopeful trends towards bringing new data to bear. For example, Tele-\nLanguage enables a human clinician to conduct language therapy sessions with \nmultiple patients simultaneously with the aid of  an AI agent trained by the clinician. \nAnd Lifegraph, which extracts behavioral patterns and creates alerts from data \npassively collected from a patient’s smartphone, has been adopted by psychiatrists in \nIsrael to detect early signs of  distressful behavior in patients.\nLooking ahead, driven by the mobile computing revolution, the astonishing growth \nof  “biometrics in the wild”—and the explosion of  platforms and applications that use \nthem—is a hopeful and unanticipated trend. Thousands of  mobile apps now offer \ninformation, introduce behavior modification, or identify groups of  “people like me.” \nThis, combined with the emerging trend of  more specialized motion tracking devices, \nsuch as Fitbit, and the emerging (inter)connectedness between the home environment \nand health-monitoring devices, has created a vibrant new sector of  innovation.\nBy combining social and healthcare data, some healthcare apps can perform data \nmining, learning, and prediction from captured data, though their predictions are \nrelatively rudimentary . The convergence of  data and functionality across applications \nwill likely spur new and even obvious products, such as an exercise app that not only \nproposes a schedule for exercise but also suggests the best time to do it, and provides \ncoaching to stick to that schedule.\n72  Azad Shademan, Ryan S.

Despite the broad opportunities in this \ndomain—basic social support, interaction and communication devices, home health \nmonitoring, a variety of  simple in-home physical aids such as walkers, and light meal  \npreparation—little has happened over the past fifteen years. But the coming generational \nshift will accompany a change in technology acceptance among the elderly . Currently , \nsomeone who is seventy was born in 1946 and may have first experienced some form \nof  personalized IT in middle age or later, while a fifty-year-old today is far more \ntechnology-friendly and savvy . As a result, there will be a growing interest and market \nfor already available and maturing technologies to support physical, emotional, social, \nand mental health. Here are a few likely examples by category:\nLife quality and independence\n• Automated transportation will support continued independence and expanded \nsocial horizons.\n• Sharing of  information will help families remain engaged with one another at a \ndistance, and predictive analytics may be used to “nudge” family groups toward \npositive behaviors, such as reminders to “call home.”\n• Smart devices in the home will help with daily living activities when needed, \nsuch as cooking and, if  robot manipulation capabilities improve sufficiently , \ndressing and toileting.\nHealth and wellness\n• Mobile applications that monitor movement and activities, coupled with social \nplatforms, will be able to make recommendations to maintain mental and \nphysical health.\n• In-home health monitoring and health information access will be able to detect \nchanges in mood or behavior and alert caregivers.\n• Personalized health management will help mitigate the complexities associated \nwith multiple co-morbid conditions and/or treatment interactions.\nTreatments and devices\n• Better hearing aids and visual assistive devices will mitigate the effects of  \nhearing and vision loss, improving safety and social connection.\n• Personalized rehabilitation and in-home therapy will reduce the need for \nhospital or care facility stays.\n• Physical assistive devices (intelligent walkers, wheel chairs, and exoskeletons) will \nextend the range of  activities of  an infirm individual.\nThe Study Panel expects an explosion of  low-cost sensing technologies that can \nprovide substantial capabilities to the elderly in their homes. In principle, social \nagents with a physical presence and simple physical capabilities (e.g. a mobile robot \nwith basic communication capabilities) could provide a platform for new innovations. \nHowever, doing so will require integration across multiple areas of  AI—Natural \nLanguage Processing, reasoning, learning, perception, and robotics—to create  \na system that is useful and usable by the elderly .\nThese innovations will also introduce questions regarding privacy within various \ncircles, including friends, family , and care-givers, and create new challenges to \naccommodate an evermore active and engaged population far past retirement.\n74  Jennifer M.

Applications \nare in wide use by educators and learners today , with some variation between K-12  \nand university settings. Though quality education will always require active engagement \nby human teachers, AI promises to enhance education at all levels, especially by \nproviding personalization at scale. Similar to healthcare, resolving how to best \nintegrate human interaction and face-to-face learning with promising AI technologies \nremains a key challenge.\nRobots have long been popular educational devices, starting with the early  \nLego Mindstorms kits developed with the MIT Media Lab in the 1980s. Intelligent \nTutoring Systems (ITS) for science, math, language, and other disciplines match \nstudents with interactive machine tutors. Natural Language Processing, especially when \ncombined with machine learning and crowdsourcing, has boosted online learning \nand enabled teachers to multiply the size of  their classrooms while simultaneously \naddressing individual students’ learning needs and styles. The data sets from large \nonline learning systems have fueled rapid growth in learning analytics.\nStill, schools and universities have been slow in adopting AI technologies primarily \ndue to lack of  funds and lack of  solid evidence that they help students achieve \nlearning objectives. Over the next fifteen years in a typical North American city , the \nuse of  intelligent tutors and other AI technologies to assist teachers in the classroom \nand in the home is likely to expand significantly , as will learning based on virtual \nreality applications. But computer-based learning systems are not likely to fully \nreplace human teaching in schools.\nTeaching robots\nToday , more sophisticated and versatile kits for use in K-12 schools are available \nfrom a number of  companies that create robots with new sensing technologies \nprogrammable in a variety of  languages. Ozobot is a robot that teaches children \nto code and reason deductively while configuring it to dance or play based on \ncolor-coded patterns.75 Cubelets help teach children logical thinking through \nassembling robot blocks to think, act, or sense, depending upon the function of  the \ndifferent blocks.76 Wonder Workshop’s Dash and Dot span a range of  programming \ncapabilities. Children eight years old and older can create simple actions using a \nvisual programming language, Blockly , or build iOS and Android applications using \nC or Java.77 PLEO rb is a robot pet that helps children learn biology by teaching \nthe robot to react to different aspects of  the environment.78 However, while fun and \nengaging for some, in order for such kits to become widespread, there will need to be \ncompelling evidence that they improve students’ academic performance.\nIntelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and online learning\nITS have been developed from research laboratory projects such as Why-2 Atlas, \nwhich supported human-machine dialogue to solve physics problems early in the \nera.79 The rapid migration of  ITS from laboratory experimental stages to real use is \n75  Ozobot, accessed August 1, 2016, http://ozobot.com/.\n76  “Cubelets,” Modular Robotics, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .modrobotics.com/\ncubelets.\n77  “Meet Dash,” Wonder Workshop, accessed August 1, 2016, https://www .makewonder.com/\ndash.\n78  “Pleo rb,” Innvo Labs, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .pleoworld.com/pleo_rb/eng/\nlifeform.php.\n79  Kurt VanLehn, Pamela W .

Downloadable software and online systems such as Carnegie \nSpeech or Duolingo provide foreign language training using Automatic Speech \nRecognition (ASR) and NLP techniques to recognize language errors and help users \ncorrect them.80 Tutoring systems such as the Carnegie Cognitive Tutor81 have been \nused in US high schools to help students learn mathematics. Other ITS have been \ndeveloped for training in geography , circuits, medical diagnosis, computer literacy \nand programming, genetics, and chemistry . Cognitive tutors use software to mimic \nthe role of  a good human tutor by , for example, providing hints when a student gets \nstuck on a math problem. Based on the hint requested and the answer provided, the \ntutor offers context specific feedback. \nApplications are growing in higher education. An ITS called SHERLOCK82 is \nbeginning to be used to teach Air Force technicians to diagnose electrical systems \nproblems in aircraft. And the University of  Southern California’s Information \nSciences Institute has developed more advanced avatar-based training modules to \ntrain military personnel being sent to international posts in appropriate behavior \nwhen dealing with people from different cultural backgrounds. New algorithms for \npersonalized tutoring, such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, enable individualized \nmastery learning and problem sequencing.83\nMost surprising has been the explosion of  the Massive Open Online Courses \n(MOOCs) and other models of  online education at all levels—including the use \nof  tools like Wikipedia and Khan Academy as well as sophisticated learning \nmanagement systems that build in synchronous as well as asynchronous education \nand adaptive learning tools. Since the late 1990s, companies such as the Educational \nTesting Service and Pearson have been developing automatic NLP assessment tools to \nco-grade essays in standardized testing.84 Many of  the MOOCs which have become \nso popular, including those created by EdX, Coursera, and Udacity , are making use \nof  NLP , machine learning, and crowdsourcing techniques for grading short-answer \nand essay questions as well as programming assignments.85 Online education systems \nthat support graduate-level professional education and lifelong learning are also \nexpanding rapidly . These systems have great promise because the need for face-to-face\ninteraction is less important for working professionals and career changers. While not \nthe leaders in AI-supported systems and applications, they will become early adopters \nas the technologies are tested and validated.\nIt can be argued that AI is the secret sauce that has enabled instructors, particularly \nin higher education, to multiply the size of  their classrooms by a few orders of  \nmagnitude—class sizes of  a few tens of  thousands are not uncommon. In order to \ncontinually test large classes of  students, automated generation of  the questions is \nPhysics Essay Writing,” Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Proceedings of  the 6th International Conference, (Springer \nBerlin Heidelberg, 2002), 158–167.\n80  VanLehn et al, “The Architecture of  Why2-Atlas.”\n81  “Resources and Support,” Carnegie Learning, accessed August 1, 2016, https://www .\ncarnegielearning.com/resources-support/.\n82  Alan Lesgold, Suzanne Lajoie, Marilyn Bunzo, and Gary Eggan, “SHERLOCK: A Coached \nPractice Environment for an Electronics Troubleshooting Job,” in J.

With the explosion of  online \ncourses, these techniques are sure to be eagerly adopted for use in online education. \nAlthough the long term impact of  these systems will have on the educational system \nremains unclear, the AI community has learned a great deal in a very short time.\nLearning analytics\nData sets being collected from massive scale online learning systems, ranging from \nMOOCs to Khan Academy , as well as smaller scale online programs, have fueled \nthe rapid growth of  the field of  learning analytics. Online courses are not only good \nfor widespread delivery , but are natural vehicles for data collection and experimental \ninstrumentation that will contribute to scientific findings and improving the quality \nof  learning at scale. Organizations such as the Society for Learning Analytics \nResearch (SOLAR), and the rise of  conferences including the Learning Analytics and \nKnowledge Conference89 and the Learning at Scale Conference (L@S)90 reflect this \ntrend. This community applies deep learning, natural language processing, and other \nAI techniques to analysis of  student engagement, behavior, and outcomes.\nCurrent projects seek to model common student misconceptions, predict \nwhich students are at risk of  failure, and provide real-time student feedback that is \ntightly integrated with learning outcomes. Recent work has also been devoted to \nunderstanding the cognitive processes involved in comprehension, writing, knowledge \nacquisition, and memory , and to applying that understanding to educational practice \nby developing and testing educational technologies.\nChallenges and opportunities\nOne might have expected more and more sophisticated use of  AI technologies in \nschools, colleges, and universities by now . Much of  its absence can be explained \nby the lack of  financial resources of  these institutions as well as the lack of  data \nestablishing the technologies’ effectiveness. These problems are being addressed, \nalbeit slowly , by private foundations and by numerous programs to train primarily \nsecondary school teachers in summer programs. As in other areas of  AI, excessive \nhype and promises about the capabilities of  MOOCs have meant that expectations \nfrequently exceed the reality . The experiences of  certain institutions, such as San Jose \nState University’s experiment with Udacity ,91 have led to more sober assessment of  \nthe potential of  the new educational technologies.\n86  Jonathan C.

Some steps in this direction are being taken now by increasing \ncollaborations between AI researchers and researchers in the humanities and social \nsciences, exemplified by Stanford’s Galileo Correspondence Project92 and Columbia’s \nMaking and Knowing Project.93 These interdisciplinary efforts create interactive \nexperiences with historical documents and the use of  Virtual Reality (VR) to explore \ninteractive archeological sites.94 VR techniques are already being used in the natural \nsciences such as biology , anatomy , geology and astronomy to allow students to interact \nwith environments and objects that are difficult to engage with in the real world. The \nrecreation of  past worlds and fictional worlds will become just as popular for studies \nof  arts and other sciences.\nAI techniques will increasingly blur the line between formal, classroom education \nand self-paced, individual learning. Adaptive learning systems, for example, are going \nto become a core part of  the teaching process in higher education because of  the \npressures to contain cost while serving a larger number of  students and moving students \nthrough school more quickly . While formal education will not disappear, the Study \nPanel believes that MOOCs and other forms of  online education will become part of  \nlearning at all levels, from K-12 through university , in a blended classroom experience. \nThis development will facilitate more customizable approaches to learning, in which \nstudents can learn at their own pace using educational techniques that work best for \nthem. Online education systems will learn as the students learn, supporting rapid \nadvances in our understanding of  the learning process. Learning analytics, in turn, will \naccelerate the development of  tools for personalized education.\nThe current transition from hard copy books to digital and audio media and texts \nis likely to become prevalent in education as well. Digital reading devices will also \nbecome much ‘smarter’, providing students with easy access to additional information \nabout subject matter as they study . Machine Translation (MT) technology will \nalso make it easier to translate educational material into different languages with a \nfair degree of  accuracy , just as it currently translates technical manuals. Textbook \ntranslation services that currently depend only upon human translators will \nincreasingly incorporate automatic methods to improve the speed and affordability of  \ntheir services for school systems.\nOnline learning systems will also expand the opportunity for adults and working \nprofessionals to enhance their knowledge and skills (or to retool and learn a new field)\n in a world where these fields are evolving rapidly . This will include the expansion \nof  fully online professional degrees as well as professional certifications based on \nonline coursework.\nBroader societal consequences\nIn countries where education is difficult for the broad population to obtain, online \nresources may have a positive effect if  the population has the tools to access them.  \nThe development of  online educational resources should make it easier for \nfoundations that support international educational programs to provide quality \n92  Stanford University: Galileo Correspondence Project, accessed August 1, 2016, http://galileo.\nstanford.edu.\n93  The Making and Knowing Project: Reconstructing the 16th Century Workshop of  BNF MS. \nFR. 640 at Columbia University , accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .makingandknowing.org.\n94  Paul James, “3D Mapped HTC Vive Demo Brings Archaeology to Life,” Road to VR, August \n31, 2015, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .roadtovr.com/3d-mapped-htc-vive-demo-brings-\narchaeology-to-life/.\nWhile formal education \nwill not disappear, the \nStudy Panel believes that \nMOOCs and other forms \nof online education will \nbecome part of learning \nat all levels, from K-12 \nthrough university, in \na blended classroom \nexperience.\n\n35\neducation by providing tools and relatively simple amounts of  training in their use. \nFor example, large numbers of  educational apps, many of  them free, are being \ndeveloped for the iPad. On the negative side, there is already a major trend among \nstudents to restrict their social contacts to electronic ones and to spend large amounts \nof  time without social contact, interacting with online programs. If  education also \noccurs more and more online, what effect will the lack of  regular, face-to-face contact \nwith peers have on students’ social development? Certain technologies have even \nbeen shown to create neurological side effects.95 On the other hand, autistic children \nhave benefited from interactions with AI systems already .96 \nLOW-RESOURCE COMMUNITIES\nMany opportunities exist for AI to improve conditions for people in low-resource \ncommunities in a typical North American city—and, indeed, in some cases it \nalready has. Understanding these direct AI contributions may also inform potential \ncontributions in the poorest parts of  the developing world. There has not been a \nsignificant focus on these populations in AI gatherings, and, traditionally , AI funders \nhave underinvested in research lacking commercial application. With targeted incentives \nand funding priorities, AI technologies could help address the needs of  low-resource \ncommunities. Budding efforts are promising. Counteracting fears that AI may contribute \nto joblessness and other societal problems, AI may provide mitigations and solutions, \nparticularly if  implemented in ways that build trust in them by the affected communities.\nMachine learning, data mining approaches\n Under the banner of  “data science for social good,” AI has been used to create \npredictive models to help government agencies more effectively use their limited \nbudgets to address problems such as lead poisoning,97 a major public health concern \nthat has been in the news due to ongoing events in Flint, Michigan. Children may \nbe tested for elevated lead levels, but that unfortunately means the problem is only \ndetected after they have already been poisoned. Many efforts are underway to use \npredictive models to assist government agencies in prioritizing children at \nrisk, including those who may not yet have been exposed.98 Similarly , the Illinois \nDepartment of  Human Services (IDHS) uses predictive models to identify pregnant \nwomen at risk for adverse birth outcomes in order to maximize the impact of  \nprenatal care. The City of  Cincinnati uses them to proactively identify and deploy \ninspectors to properties at risk of  code violations.\nScheduling, planning\nTask assignment scheduling and planning techniques have been applied by many \ndifferent groups to distribute food before it spoils from those who may have excess, \nsuch as restaurants, to food banks, community centers and individuals.99\n95  Scientist have studied, for example, the way reliance on GPS may lead to changes in the \nhippocampus.

For example, AI might be able to assist in spreading health-\nrelated information. In Los Angeles, there are more than 5,000 homeless youth (ages \nthirteen-twenty-four). Individual interventions are difficult and expensive, and the \nyouths’ mistrust of  authority dictates that key messages are best spread through peer \nleaders. AI programs might be able to leverage homeless youth social networks to \nstrategically select peer leaders to spread health-related information, such as how to \navoid spread of  HIV . The dynamic, uncertain nature of  these networks does pose \nchallenges for AI research.100 Care must also be taken to prevent AI systems from \nreproducing discriminatory behavior, such as machine learning that identifies people \nthrough illegal racial indicators, or through highly-correlated surrogate factors, such \nas zip codes. But if  deployed with great care, greater reliance on AI may well result \nin a reduction in discrimination overall, since AI programs are inherently more easily \naudited than humans.\nPUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY\nCities already have begun to deploy AI technologies for public safety and security . \nBy 2030, the typical North American city will rely heavily upon them. These include \ncameras for surveillance that can detect anomalies pointing to a possible crime, \ndrones, and predictive policing applications. As with most issues, there are benefits \nand risks. Gaining public trust is crucial. While there are legitimate concerns that \npolicing that incorporates AI may become overbearing or pervasive in some contexts, \nthe opposite is also possible. AI may enable policing to become more targeted and \nused only when needed. And assuming careful deployment, AI may also help remove \nsome of  the bias inherent in human decision-making.\nOne of  the more successful uses of  AI analytics is in detecting white collar \ncrime, such as credit card fraud.101 Cybersecurity (including spam) is a widely shared \nconcern, and machine learning is making an impact. AI tools may also prove useful \nin helping police manage crime scenes or search and rescue events by helping \ncommanders prioritize tasks and allocate resources, though these tools are not yet \nready for automating such activities. Improvements in machine learning in general, \nand transfer learning in particular—for speeding up learning in new scenarios based \non similarities with past scenarios—may facilitate such systems. \nThe cameras deployed almost everywhere in the world today tend to be more \nuseful for helping solve crimes than preventing them.102 103 This is due to the low \nquality of  event identification from videos and the lack of  manpower to look at \nmassive video streams. As AI for this domain improves, it will better assist crime \nprevention and prosecution through greater accuracy of  event classification and \nefficient automatic processing of  video to detect anomalies—including, potentially , \n407–426.\n100  Jordan Pearson, “ Artificial Intelligence Could Help Reduce HIV Among Homeless Y ouths,” \nTeamcore, University of  Southern California, February 4. 2015, accessed August 1, 2016, http://\nteamcore.usc.edu/news/motherboard_news_ai_could_help_reduce_HIV .pdf.\n101  “RSA Adaptive Authentication,” RSA, accessed August 1, 2016, https://www .rsa.com/en-us/\nproducts-services/fraud-prevention/adaptive-authentication.\n102  Takeshi Arikuma and Yasunori Mochizuki, “Intelligent multimedia surveillance system for \nsafer cities” APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing 5 (2016): 1–8.\n103  “Big Op-Ed: Shifting Opinions On Surveillance Cameras,”, T alk of  the Nation, NPR, April 22, \n2013, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .npr.org/2013/04/22/178436355/big-op-ed-shifting-\nopinions-on-surveillance-cameras.\nOne of the more successful \nuses of AI analytics is in \ndetecting white collar \ncrime, such as credit \ncard fraud. Cybersecurity \n(including spam) is a \nwidely shared concern, \nand machine learning is \nmaking an impact.\n\n37\nevidence of  police malpractice. These improvements could lead to even more \nwidespread surveillance. Some cities have already added drones for surveillance \npurposes, and police use of  drones to maintain security of  ports, airports, coastal \nareas, waterways, industrial facilities is likely to increase, raising concerns about \nprivacy , safety , and other issues.\nThe New Y ork Police Department’s CompStat was the first tool pointing toward \npredictive policing,104 and many police departments now use it.105 Machine learning \nsignificantly enhances the ability to predict where and when crimes are more likely \nto happen and who may commit them. As dramatized in the movie Minority Report, \npredictive policing tools raise the specter of  innocent people being unjustifiably \ntargeted. But well-deployed AI prediction tools have the potential to actually remove \nor reduce human bias, rather than reinforcing it, and research and resources should \nbe directed toward ensuring this effect.\nAI techniques can be used to develop intelligent simulations for training law-\nenforcement personnel to collaborate. While international criminal organizations and \nterrorists from different countries are colluding, police forces from different countries \nstill face difficulty in joining forces to fight them. Training international groups of  law \nenforcement personnel to work as teams is very challenging. The European Union, \nthrough the Horizon 2020 program, currently supports such attempts in projects such \nas LawTrain.106 The next step will be to move from simulation to actual investigations \nby providing tools that support such collaborations.\nTools do exist for scanning Twitter and other feeds to look for certain types \nof  events and how they may impact security . For example, AI can help in social \nnetwork analysis to prevent those at risk from being radicalized by ISIS or other \nviolent groups. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly interested in trying to \ndetect plans for disruptive events from social media, and also to monitor activity at \nlarge gatherings of  people to analyze security . There is significant work on crowd \nsimulations to determine how crowds can be controlled. At the same time, legitimate \nconcerns have been raised about the potential for law enforcement agencies to \noverreach and use such tools to violate people’s privacy .\nThe US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Coast Guard, and the \nmany other security agencies that currently rely on AI will likely increase their \nreliance to enable significant efficiency and efficacy improvements.107 AI techniques—\nvision, speech analysis, and gait analysis— can aid interviewers, interrogators, and \nsecurity guards in detecting possible deception and criminal behavior. For example, \nthe TSA currently has an ambitious project to redo airport security nationwide.108 \nCalled DARMS, the system is designed to improve efficiency and efficacy of  airport \nsecurity by relying on personal information to tailor security based on a person’s risk \ncategorization and the flights being taken. The future vision for this project is a tunnel \nthat checks people’s security while they walk through it. Once again, developers of  \nthis technology should be careful to avoid building in bias (e.g. about a person’s risk \nlevel category) through use of  datasets that reflect prior bias.109\n104  Walter L.

In the past fifteen years, employment \nhas shifted due to a major recession and increasing globalization, particularly with \nChina’s introduction to the world economy , as well as enormous changes in non-AI \ndigital technology . Since the 1990s, the US has experienced continued growth in \nproductivity and GDP , but median income has stagnated and the employment to \npopulation ratio has fallen.\nThere are clear examples of  industries in which digital technologies have had \nprofound impacts, good and bad, and other sectors in which automation will likely \nmake major changes in the near future. Many of  these changes have been driven \nstrongly by “routine” digital technologies, including enterprise resource planning, \nnetworking, information processing, and search. Understanding these changes should \nprovide insights into how AI will affect future labor demand, including the shift in \nskill demands. To date, digital technologies have been affecting workers more in the \nskilled middle, such as travel agents, rather than the very lowest-skilled or highest \nskilled work.110 On the other hand, the spectrum of  tasks that digital systems can \ndo is evolving as AI systems improve, which is likely to gradually increase the scope \nof  what is considered routine. AI is also creeping into high end of  the spectrum, \nincluding professional services not historically performed by machines.\nTo be successful, AI innovations will need to overcome understandable human \nfears of  being marginalized. AI will likely replace tasks rather than jobs in the near \nterm, and will also create new kinds of  jobs. But the new jobs that will emerge are \nharder to imagine in advance than the existing jobs that will likely be lost. Changes \nin employment usually happen gradually , often without a sharp transition, a trend \nlikely to continue as AI slowly moves into the workplace. A spectrum of  effects will \nemerge, ranging from small amounts of  replacement or augmentation to complete \nreplacement. For example, although most of  a lawyer’s job is not yet automated,111  \nAI applied to legal information extraction and topic modeling has automated parts of  \nfirst-year lawyers’ jobs.112 In the not too distant future, a diverse array of  job-holders, \nfrom radiologists to truck drivers to gardeners, may be affected.\nAI may also influence the size and location of  the workforce. Many organizations \nand institutions are large because they perform functions that can be scaled only by \nadding human labor, either “horizontally” across geographical areas or “vertically” \nin management hierarchies. As AI takes over many functions, scalability no longer \nimplies large organizations. Many have noted the small number of  employees of  \nsome high profile internet companies, but not of  others. There may be a natural scale \nof  human enterprise, perhaps where the CEO can know everyone in the company . \nThrough the creation of  efficiently outsourced labor markets enabled by AI, \nenterprises may tend towards that natural size.\nAI will also create jobs, especially in some sectors, by making certain tasks more \nimportant, and create new categories of  employment by making new modes of  \ninteraction possible. Sophisticated information systems can be used to create new \n110  Jeremy Ashkenas and Alicia Parlapiano, “How the Recession Reshaped the Economy , in 255 \nCharts,” The New Y ork Times, June 6, 2014, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .nytimes.com/\ninteractive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html.\n111  R Dana Remus and Frank S.

A vibrant research \ncommunity within AI studies further ways of  creating new markets and making \nexisting ones operate more efficiently . \nWhile work has intrinsic value, most people work to be able to purchase goods and \nservices they value. Because AI systems perform work that previously required human \nlabor, they have the effect of  lowering the cost of  many goods and services, effectively \nmaking everyone richer. But as exemplified in current political debates, job loss is \nmore salient to people—especially those directly affected—than diffuse economic \ngains, and AI unfortunately is often framed as a threat to jobs rather than a boon to \nliving standards. \nThere is even fear in some quarters that advances in AI will be so rapid as \nto replace all human jobs—including those that are largely cognitive or involve \njudgment—within a single generation. This sudden scenario is highly unlikely , but \nAI will gradually invade almost all employment sectors, requiring a shift away from \nhuman labor that computers are able to take over.\nThe economic effects of  AI on cognitive human jobs will be analogous to  \nthe effects of  automation and robotics on humans in manufacturing jobs. Many \nmiddle-aged workers have lost well-paying factory jobs and the socio-economic status \nin family and society that traditionally went with such jobs. An even larger fraction  \nof  the total workforce may , in the long run, lose well-paying “cognitive” jobs. As labor \nbecomes a less important factor in production as compared to owning intellectual \ncapital, a majority of  citizens may find the value of  their labor insufficient to pay for \na socially acceptable standard of  living. These changes will require a political, rather \nthan a purely economic, response concerning what kind of  social safety nets should \nbe in place to protect people from large, structural shifts in the economy . Absent \nmitigating policies, the beneficiaries of  these shifts may be a small group at the  \nupper stratum of  the society .113\nIn the short run, education, re-training, and inventing new goods and services may \nmitigate these effects. Longer term, the current social safety net may need to evolve into \nbetter social services for everyone, such as healthcare and education, or a guaranteed \nbasic income. Indeed, countries such as Switzerland and Finland have actively considered \nsuch measures. AI may be thought of  as a radically different mechanism of  wealth \ncreation in which everyone should be entitled to a portion of  the world’s AI-produced \ntreasure.114 It is not too soon for social debate on how the economic fruits of   \nAI-technologies should be shared. As children in traditional societies support their  \naging parents, perhaps our artificially intelligent “children” should support us, the \n“parents” of  their intelligence.\n113  For example, Brynjolfsson and McAfee, Second Machine Age, have two chapters of  devoted to \nthis (Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a \nTime of  Brilliant T echnologies, (New Y ork: W . W . Norton & Company , Inc., 2014)) and Brynjolfsson, \nMcAfee, and Spence describe policy responses for the combination of  globalization and digital \ntechnology (Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee, and Michael Spence, Foreign Affairs, July/August \n2014, accessed August 1, 2016, https://www .foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/ \n2014-06-04/new-world-order).\n114  GDP does not do a good job of  measuring the value of  many digital goods. When society \ncan’t manage what isn’t measured, bad policy decisions result. One alternative is to look at \nconsumer surplus, not just dollar flows. As AI is embodied in more goods, this issue becomes more \nsalient. It may look like GDP goes down but people have better well-being through access to these \ndigital goods. See Erik Brynjolfsson and Adam Saunders, “What the GDP Gets Wrong (Why \nManagers Should Care),” Sloan Management Review, vol. 51, no. 1 (October 1, 2009): 95–96.\nAs labor becomes a \nless important factor in \nproduction as compared \nto owning intellectual \ncapital, a majority of \ncitizens may find the value \nof their labor insufficient \nto pay for a socially \nacceptable standard of \nliving.\n\n40\nENTERTAINMENT\nWith the explosive growth of  the internet over the past fifteen years, few can imagine \ntheir daily lives without it. Powered by AI, the internet has established user-generated \ncontent as a viable source of  information and entertainment. Social networks such \nas Facebook are now pervasive, and they function as personalized channels of  \nsocial interaction and entertainment—sometimes to the detriment of  interpersonal \ninteraction. Apps such as WhatsApp and Snapchat enable smart-phone users to \nremain constantly “in touch” with peers and share sources of  entertainment and \ninformation. In on-line communities such as Second Life and role-playing games such \nas World of  Warcraft, people imagine an alternative existence in a virtual world.115 \nSpecialized devices, such as Amazon’s Kindle have also redefined the essentials of  \nlong-cherished pastimes. Books can now be browsed and procured with a few swipes \nof  the finger, stored by the thousands in a pocket-sized device, and read in much the \nsame way as a handheld paperback.\nTrusted platforms now exist for sharing and browsing blogs, videos, photos, and \ntopical discussions, in addition to a variety of  other user-generated information. To \noperate at the scale of  the internet, these platforms must rely on techniques that are \nbeing actively developed in natural language processing, information retrieval, image \nprocessing, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Algorithms such as collaborative \nfiltering have been developed, for example, to recommend relevant movies, songs, or \narticles based on the user’s demographic details and browsing history .116\nTraditional sources of  entertainment have also embraced AI to keep pace with the  \ntimes. As exemplified in the book and movie Moneyball, professional sport is now subjected \nto intensive quantitative analysis.117 Beyond aggregate performance statistics, on-field \nsignals can be monitored using sophisticated sensors and cameras. Software has been \ncreated for composing music118 and recognizing soundtracks.119 Techniques from computer \nvision and NLP have been used in creating stage performances.120 Even the lay user can \nexercise his or her creativity on platforms such as WordsEye, which automatically \ngenerates 3D scenes from natural language text.121 AI has also come to the aid of  \nhistorical research in the arts, and is used extensively in stylometry and, more recently , \nin the analysis of  paintings.122\nThe enthusiasm with which humans have responded to AI-driven entertainment \nhas been surprising and led to concerns that it reduces interpersonal interaction \namong human beings. Few predicted that people would spend hours on end \ninteracting with a display . Children often appear to be genuinely happier playing \nat home on their devices rather than outside with their friends.

Research \nshould be directed toward \nunderstanding how to \nleverage these attributes \nfor individuals’ and \nsociety’s benefit.\n\n41\nImagining the Future\nThe success of  any form of  entertainment is ultimately determined by the individuals \nand social groups that are its subjects. The modes of  entertainment that people find  \nappealing are diverse and change over time. It is therefore hard to predict the forms \nentertainment will take in the next fifteen years precisely . Nevertheless, current trends  \nsuggest at least a few features that the future entertainment landscape is likely to contain.\nTo date, the information revolution has mostly unfolded in software. However, \nwith the growing availability of  cheaper sensors and devices, greater innovation in the \nhardware used in entertainment systems is expected. Virtual reality and haptics could \nenter our living rooms—personalized companion robots are already being developed.123 \nWith the accompanying improvements in Automatic Speech Recognition, the Study \nPanel expects that interaction with robots and other entertainment systems will become \ndialogue-based, perhaps constrained at the start, but progressively more human-like. \nEqually , the interacting systems are predicted to develop new characteristics such as \nemotion, empathy , and adaptation to environmental rhythms such as time of  day .124\nToday , an amateur with a video camera and readily-available software tools can \nmake a relatively good movie. In the future, more sophisticated tools and apps will \nbecome available to make it even easier to produce high-quality content, for example, \nto compose music or to choreograph dance using an avatar. The creation and \ndissemination of  entertainment will benefit from the progress of  technologies such as \nASR, dubbing, and Machine Translation, which will enable content to be customized \nto different audiences inexpensively . This democratization and proliferation of  AI-\ncreated media makes it difficult to predict how humans’ taste for entertainment, which \nare already fluid, will evolve.\nWith content increasingly delivered digitally , and large amounts of  data being \nlogged about consumers’ preferences and usage characteristics, media powerhouses \nwill be able to micro-analyze and micro-serve content to increasingly specialized \nsegments of  the population—down to the individual.125 Conceivably the stage is set \nfor the emergence of  media conglomerates acting as “Big Brothers” who are able to \ncontrol the ideas and online experiences to which specific individuals are exposed. \nIt remains to be seen whether broader society will develop measures to prevent their \nemergence. This topic, along with others pertaining to AI-related policy , is treated in \nmore detail in the next section.\n123  Emoters, accessed August 1, 2016, http://emoterbots.com/.\n124  “Siri,” Apple, Inc., accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .apple.com/in/ios/siri/.\n125  Ryan Calo, “Digital Market Manipulation,” George Washington Law Review 82, no. 4 (2014): \n995–1051.\nMore sophisticated tools \nand apps will become \navailable to make it \neven easier to produce \nhigh-quality content, for \nexample, to compose \nmusic or to choreograph \ndance using an avatar.\n\n42\nSECTION III: PROSPECTS AND \nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR AI PUBLIC POLICY\nThe goal of  AI applications must be to create value for society. Our policy recommendations \nflow from this goal, and, while this report is focused on a typical North American city in \n2030, the recommendations are broadly applicable to other places over time. Strategies that \nenhance our ability to interpret AI systems and participate in their use may help build trust \nand prevent drastic failures. Care must be taken to augment and enhance human capabilities \nand interaction, and to avoid discrimination against segments of  society. Research to encourage \nthis direction and inform public policy debates should be emphasized. Given the current \nsector-specific regulation of  US industries, new or retooled laws and policies will be needed \nto address the widespread impacts AI is likely to bring. Rather than “more” or “stricter” \nregulation, policies should be designed to encourage helpful innovation, generate and transfer \nexpertise, and foster broad corporate and civic responsibility for addressing critical societal \nissues raised by these technologies. In the long term, AI will enable new wealth creation that \nwill require social debate on how the economic fruits of  AI technologies should be shared.\nAI POLICY, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE\nThroughout history , humans have both shaped and adapted to new technologies. This \nreport anticipates that advances in AI technologies will be developed and fielded \ngradually—not in sudden, unexpected jumps in the techniques themselves—and will  \nbuild on what exists today , making this adaptation easier. On the other hand, small  \nimprovements to techniques, computing power, or availability of  data can occasionally \nlead to novel, game-changing applications. The measure of  success for AI applications \nis the value they create for human lives. Going forward, the ease with which people \nuse and adapt to AI applications will likewise largely determine their success.\nConversely , since AI applications are susceptible to errors and failures, a mark of   \ntheir success will be how users perceive and tolerate their shortcomings. As AI becomes \nincreasingly embedded in daily lives and used for more critical tasks, system mistakes \nmay lead to backlash from users and negatively affect their trust. Though accidents \nin a self-driving car may be less probable than those driven by humans, for example, \nthey will attract more attention. Design strategies that enhance the ability of  humans \nto understand AI systems and decisions (such as explicitly explaining those decisions),  \nand to participate in their use, may help build trust and prevent drastic failures. Likewise, \ndevelopers should help manage people’s expectations, which will affect their happiness \nand satisfaction with AI applications. Frustration in carrying out functions promised \nby a system diminishes people’s trust and reduces their willingness to use the system \nin the future.\nAnother important consideration is how AI systems that take over certain tasks \nwill affect people’s affordances and capabilities. As machines deliver super-human \nperformances on some tasks, people’s ability to perform them may wither. Already , \nintroducing calculators to classrooms has reduced children’s ability to do basic \narithmetic operations. Still, humans and AI systems have complementary abilities. \nPeople are likely to focus on tasks that machines cannot do as well, including complex \nreasoning and creative expression.\nAlready , children are increasingly exposed to AI applications, such as interacting \nwith personal assistants on cell phones or with virtual agents in theme parks. Having \nearly exposure will improve children’s interactions with AI applications, which \nwill become a natural part of  their daily lives. As a result, gaps will appear in how \nyounger and older generations perceive AI’s influences on society .\nThe measure of success \nfor AI applications is \nthe value they create \nfor human lives. Going \nforward, the ease with \nwhich people use and \nadapt to AI applications \nwill likewise largely \ndetermine their success.\n\n43\nLikewise, AI could widen existing inequalities of  opportunity if  access to AI \ntechnologies—along with the high-powered computation and large-scale data that \nfuel many of  them—is unfairly distributed across society . These technologies will \nimprove the abilities and efficiency of  people who have access to them. A person with \naccess to accurate Machine Translation technology will be better able to use learning \nresources available in different languages. Similarly , if  speech translation technology is \nonly available in English, people who do not speak English will be at a disadvantage.\nFurther, AI applications and the data they rely upon may reflect the biases of  their \ndesigners and users, who specify the data sources. This threatens to deepen existing \nsocial biases, and concentrate AI’s benefits unequally among different subgroups \nof  society . For example, some speech recognition technologies do not work well for \nwomen and people with accents. As AI is increasingly used in critical applications, \nthese biases may surface issues of  fairness to diverse groups in society . On the other \nhand, compared to the well-documented biases in human decision-making, AI-based \ndecision-making tools have the potential to significantly reduce the bias in critical \ndecisions such as who is lent money or sent to jail.\nPrivacy concerns about AI-enabled surveillance are also widespread, particularly \nin cities with pervasive instrumentation. Sousveillance, the recording of  an activity \nby a participant, usually with portable personal devices, has increased as well. Since \nviews about bias and privacy are based on personal and societal ethical and value \njudgments, the debates over how to address these concerns will likely grow and resist \nquick resolution. Similarly , since AI is generating significant wealth, debates will grow \nregarding how the economic fruits of  AI technologies should be shared—especially as \nAI expertise and the underlying data sets that fuel applications are concentrated in a \nsmall number of  large corporations.\nTo help address these concerns about the individual and societal implications  \nof  rapidly evolving AI technologies, the Study Panel offers three general policy \nrecommendations: \n1. Define a path toward accruing technical expertise in AI at all \nlevels of  government. Effective governance requires more experts \nwho understand and can analyze the interactions between AI \ntechnologies, programmatic objectives, and overall societal values.\nAbsent sufficient technical expertise to assess safety or other metrics, national or  \nlocal officials may refuse to permit a potentially promising application. Or insufficiently \ntrained officials may simply take the word of  industry technologists and green light a \nsensitive application that has not been adequately vetted. Without an understanding \nof  how AI systems interact with human behavior and societal values, officials will be \npoorly positioned to evaluate the impact of  AI on programmatic objectives. \n2. Remove the perceived and actual impediments to research on the \nfairness, security , privacy , and social impacts of  AI systems.\nSome interpretations of  federal laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  \nand the anti-circumvention provision of  the Digital Millennium Copyright Act are  \nambiguous regarding whether and how proprietary AI systems may be reverse engineered \nand evaluated by academics, journalists, and other researchers. Such research is critical  \nif  AI systems with physical and other material consequences are to be properly vetted \nand held accountable. \n3. Increase public and private funding for interdisciplinary studies of  \nthe societal impacts of  AI.\nAs a society , we are underinvesting resources in research on the societal implications  \nof  AI technologies. Private and public dollars should be directed toward interdisciplinary \nAI could widen \nexisting inequalities of \nopportunity if access to \nAI technologies—along \nwith the high-powered \ncomputation and large-\nscale data that fuel \nmany of them—is unfairly \ndistributed across society.\n\n44\nteams capable of  analyzing AI from multiple angles. Research questions range from \nbasic research into intelligence to methods to assess and affect the safety , privacy , \nfairness, and other impacts of  AI.\nQuestions include: Who is responsible when a self-driven car crashes or an \nintelligent medical device fails? How can AI applications be prevented from unlawful \ndiscrimination? Who should reap the gains of  efficiencies enabled by AI technologies \nand what protections should be afforded to people whose skills are rendered obsolete? \nAs AI becomes integrated more broadly and deeply into industrial and consumer \nproducts, it enters areas in which established regulatory regimes will need to be \nadapted to AI innovations or in some cases fundamentally reconfigured according to \nbroadly accepted goals and principles.\nThe approach in the United States to date has been sector-specific, with oversight \nby a variety of  agencies. The use of  AI in devices that deliver medical diagnostics and \ntreatments is subject to aggressive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA), both in defining what the product is and specifying the methods by which it is \nproduced, including standards of  software engineering. The use of  drones in regulated \nairspace falls under the authority of  the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).126 For \nconsumer-facing AI systems, regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) comes \ninto play . Financial markets using AI technologies, such as in high-frequency trading, \ncome under regulation by the Security Exchange Commission (SEC).\nIn addition to sector-specific approaches, the somewhat ambiguous and broad \nregulatory category of  “critical infrastructure” may apply to AI applications.127 The \nObama Administration’s Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 21 broadly defines critical \ninfrastructure as composed of  “the assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or \nvirtual, so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have \na debilitating effect on security , national economic security , national public health or \nsafety , or any combination thereof.” Today , an enterprise does not come under federal \nregulation solely by falling under that broad definition. Instead, the general trend of  \nfederal policy is to seek regulation in sixteen sectors of  the economy .128\nAs regards AI, critical infrastructure is notably defined by the end-user application, \nand not the technology or sector that actually produces AI software.129 Software \n126  FAA controls the ways drones fly , requires drones to be semiautonomous as opposed to \nautonomous, requires visual connection to the drone, and enforces no-fly zones close to airports.\n127  “Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-21)—Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience,” The \nWhite House, February 12, 2013, accessed August 1, 2016, https://www .whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2013/02/12/presidential-policy-directive-critical-infrastructure-security-and-resil.\n128  PPD 21 identifies agencies responsible in each case. Chemical: Department of  Homeland \nSecurity; Commercial Facilities: Department of  Homeland Security; Communications: Department \nof  Homeland Security; Critical Manufacturing: Department of  Homeland Security; Dams: \nDepartment of  Homeland Security; Defense Industrial Base: Department of  Defense; Emergency \nServices: Department of  Homeland Security; Energy: Department of  Energy; Financial Services: \nDepartment of  the Treasury; Food and Agriculture: U.S. Department of  Agriculture and \nDepartment of  Health and Human Services; Government Facilities: Department of  Homeland \nSecurity and General Services Administration; Healthcare and Public Health: Department of  \nHealth and Human Services; Information Technology: Department of  Homeland Security; \nNuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste: Department of  Homeland Security; Transportation \nSystems: Department of  Homeland Security and Department of  Transportation; Water and \nWastewater Systems: Environmental Protection Agency .\n129  In “ICYMI- Business Groups Urge White House to Rethink Cyber Security Order,” Internet \nAssociation, March 5, 2013, accessed August 1, 2016, https://internetassociation.org/030513gov-3/: \n“Obama’s Feb. 12 order says the government can’t designate ‘commercial information technology \nproducts’ or consumer information technology services as critical U.S. infrastructure targeted for \nvoluntary computer security standards,’ ... ‘Obama’s order isn’t meant to get down to the level \nof  products and services and dictate how those products and services behave,’ said David LeDuc, \nsenior director of  public policy for the Software & Information Industry Association, a Washington \ntrade group that lobbied for the exclusions.”\nAs a society, we are \nunderinvesting resources \nin research on the \nsocietal implications of \nAI technologies. Private \nand public dollars should \nbe directed toward \ninterdisciplinary teams \ncapable of analyzing AI \nfrom multiple angles.\n\n45\ncompanies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon have actively lobbied to avoid \nbeing designated as critical to the economy , arguing that this would open the door to  \nregulation that would inevitably compromise their rapid product development cycles  \nand ability to innovate.130 Nonetheless, as the companies creating, operating, and \nmaintaining critical infrastructure use AI, interest will grow in regulating that software. \nSome existing regulatory regimes for software safety (for example, the FDA ’s \nregulation of  high consequence medical software) require specific software \nengineering practices at the developer level. However, modern software systems \nare often assembled from library components which may be supplied by multiple \nvendors, and are relatively application-independent. It doesn’t seem feasible or \ndesirable to subject all such developers to the standards required for the most critical, \nrare applications. Nor does it seem advisable to allow unregulated use of  such \ncomponents in safety critical applications. Tradeoffs between promoting innovation \nand regulating for safety are difficult ones, both conceptually and in practice. At a \nminimum, regulatory entities will require greater expertise going forward in order to \nunderstand the implications of  standards and measures put in place by researchers, \ngovernment, and industry .131\nPolicy and legal considerations\nWhile a comprehensive examination of  the ways artificial intelligence (AI) interacts \nwith the law is beyond the scope of  this inaugural report, this much seems clear:  \nas a transformative technology , AI has the potential to challenge any number of  \nlegal assumptions in the short, medium, and long term. Precisely how law and policy \nwill adapt to advances in AI—and how AI will adapt to values reflected in law and \npolicy—depends on a variety of  social, cultural, economic, and other factors, and  \nis likely to vary by jurisdiction.\nAmerican law represents a mixture of  common law , federal, state, and local \nstatutes and ordinances, and—perhaps of  greatest relevance to AI—regulations. \nDepending on its instantiation, AI could implicate each of  these sources of  law . For  \nexample, Nevada passed a law broadly permitting autonomous vehicles and instructed \nthe Nevada Department of  Motor V ehicles to craft requirements. Meanwhile, the \nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration has determined that a self-\ndriving car system, rather than the vehicle occupants, can be considered the “driver” \nof  a vehicle. Some car designs sidestep this issue by staying in autonomous mode \nonly when hands are on the wheel (at least every so often), so that the human driver \nhas ultimate control and responsibility . Still, Tesla’s adoption of  this strategy did not \nprevent the first traffic fatality involving an autonomous car, which occurred in June \nof  2016. Such incidents are sure to influence public attitudes towards autonomous \ndriving. And as most people’s first experience with embodied agents, autonomous \ntransportation will strongly influence the public’s perception of  AI.\nDriverless cars are, of  course, but one example of  the many instantiations of   \nAI in services, products, and other contexts. The legal effect of  introducing AI into \nthe provision of  tax advice, automated trading on the stock market, or generating  \nmedical diagnoses will also vary in accordance to the regulators that govern \nthese contexts and the rules that apply within them. Many other examples of  AI \napplications fall within current non-technology-specific policy , including predictive \n130  Eric Engleman, “Google Exception in Obama’s Cyber Order Questioned as Unwise Gap,” \nBloomberg T echnology, March 4, 2013, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .bloomberg.com/news/\narticles/2013-03-05/google-exception-in-obama-s-cyber-order-questioned-as-unwise-gap.\n131  Ryan Calo, “The Case for a Federal Robotics Commission,” Brookings Report, September 15, \n2014, accessed August 1, 2016, http://www .brookings.edu/research/reports2/2014/09/case-for-\nfederal-robotics-commission.\nAbsent sufficient technical \nexpertise to assess \nsafety or other metrics, \nnational or local officials \nmay refuse to permit a \npotentially promising \napplication—or green light \na sensitive application that \nhas not been adequately \nvetted.\n\n46\npolicing, non-discriminatory loans, healthcare applications such as eldercare and  \ndrug delivery , systems designed to interact with children (for example, autonomous \ntutoring systems are required to respect laws in regard to balanced handling of  \nevolution vs. intelligent design), and interactive entertainment.\nGiven the present structure of  American administrative law , it seems unlikely  \nthat AI will be treated comprehensively in the near term. Nevertheless, it is possible  \nto enumerate broad categories of  legal and policy issues that AI tends to raise in \nvarious contexts.\nPrivacy\nPrivate information about an individual can be revealed through decisions and \npredictions made by AI. While some of  the ways that AI implicates privacy mirror \nthose of  technologies such as computers and the internet, other issues may be unique \nto AI. For example, the potential of  AI to predict future behavior based on previous \npatterns raises challenging questions. Companies already use machine learning to \npredict credit risk. And states run prisoner details through complex algorithms to \npredict the likelihood of  recidivism when considering parole. In these cases, it is a \ntechnical challenge to ensure that factors such as race and sexual orientation are not \nbeing used to inform AI-based decisions. Even when such features are not directly \nprovided to the algorithms, they may still correlate strongly with seemingly innocuous \nfeatures such as zip code. Nonetheless, with careful design, testing, and deployment, \nAI algorithms may be able to make less biased decisions than a typical person.\nAnthropomorphic interfaces increasingly associated with AI raise novel privacy \nconcerns. Social science research suggests people are hardwired to respond to \nanthropomorphic technology as though it were human. Subjects in one study \nwere more likely to answer when they were born if  the computer first stated \nwhen it was built.132 In another, they skipped sensitive questions when posed by an \nanthropomorphic interface.133 At a basic level lies the question: Will humans continue \nto enjoy the prospect of  solitude in a world permeated by apparently social agents \n“living” in our houses, cars, offices, hospital rooms, and phones?134\nInnovation policy\nEarly law and policy decisions concerning liability and speech helped ensure the \ncommercial viability of  the Internet. By contrast, the software industry arguably \nsuffers today from the decision of  firms to pivot from open and free software to the \nmore aggressive pursuit of  intellectual property protections, resulting in what some \nhave termed patent “thickets.” Striking the proper balance between incentivizing \ninnovation in AI while promoting cooperation and protection against third party \nharm will prove a central challenge.\nLiability (civil)\nAs AI is organized to directly affect the world, even physically , liability for harms \ncaused by AI will increase in salience. The prospect that AI will behave in ways \ndesigners do not expect challenges the prevailing assumption within tort law that \ncourts only compensate for foreseeable injuries. Courts might arbitrarily assign \nliability to a human actor even when liability is better located elsewhere for reasons \nof  fairness or efficiency . Alternatively , courts could refuse to find liability because \nthe defendant before the court did not, and could not, foresee the harm that the AI \ncaused. Liability would then fall by default on the blameless victim.

Ryan Calo, “People Can Be So Fake: A New Dimension to Privacy and Technology \nScholarship,” Penn State Law Review 114, no. 3 (2010): 809–855.\nAs AI applications engage \nin behavior that, were it \ndone by a human, would \nconstitute a crime, courts \nand other legal actors will \nhave to puzzle through \nwhom to hold accountable \nand on what theory.\n\n47\nof  product liability—and the responsibility that falls to companies manufacturing \nthese products— will likely grow when human actors become less responsible for the \nactions of  a machine.\nLiability (criminal)\nIf  tort law expects harms to be foreseeable, criminal law goes further to expect that \nharms be intended. US law in particular attaches great importance to the concept of  \nmens rea—the intending mind. As AI applications engage in behavior that, were it \ndone by a human, would constitute a crime, courts and other legal actors will have to \npuzzle through whom to hold accountable and on what theory .\nAgency\nThe above issues raise the question of  whether and under what circumstances an \nAI system could operate as the agent of  a person or corporation. Already regulatory \nbodies in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere are setting the conditions under \nwhich software can enter into a binding contract.135 The more AI conducts legally \nsalient activities, the greater the challenge to principles of  agency under the law .\nCertification\nThe very notion of  “artificial intelligence” suggests a substitution for human skill \nand ingenuity . And in many contexts, ranging from driving to performing surgery or \npracticing law , a human must attain some certification or license before performing \na given task. Accordingly , law and policy will have to—and already does—grapple \nwith how to determine competency in an AI system. For example, imagine a \nrobotics company creates a surgical platform capable of  autonomously removing an \nappendix. Or imagine a law firm writes an application capable of  rendering legal \nadvice. Today , it is unclear from a legal perspective who in this picture would have to \npass the medical boards or legal bar, let alone where they would be required to do so.136\nLabor\nAs AI substitutes for human roles, some jobs will be eliminated and new jobs will \nbe created. The net effect on jobs is ambiguous, but labor markets are unlikely to \nbenefit everyone evenly . The demand for some types of  skills or abilities will likely \ndrop significantly , negatively affecting the employment levels and wages of  people \nwith those skills.137 While the ultimate effects on income levels and distribution are not \ninevitable, they depend substantially on government policies, on the way companies \nchoose to organize work, and on decisions by individuals to invest in learning new \nskills and seeking new types of  work and income opportunities. People who find their \nemployment altered or terminated as a consequence of  advances of  AI may seek \nrecourse in the legislature and courts. This may be why Littler Mendelson LLP—\nperhaps the largest employment law firm in the world—has an entire practice group \nto address robotics and artificial intelligence.\nTaxation\nFederal, state, and local revenue sources may be affected. Accomplishing a task using AI \ninstead of  a person can be faster and more accurate—and avoid employment taxes.  \nAs a result, AI applications could increasingly shift investment from payroll and \nincome to capital expenditure. Depending on a state budget’s reliance on payroll \nand income tax, such a shift could be destabilizing. AI may also display different \n135  Ian R.

The many municipalities \nrelying on income from speeding or parking tickets will have to find alternatives \nif  autonomous cars can drop people off and find distance parking, or if  they are \nprogrammed not to violate the law . As a result, government bodies trying to balance \ntheir budgets in light of  advances in AI may pass legislation to slow down or alter the \ncourse of  the technology .\nPolitics\nAI technologies are already being used by political actors in gerrymandering and \ntargeted “robocalls” designed to suppress votes, and on social media platforms in the \nform of  “bots.”138 They can enable coordinated protest as well as the ability to predict \nprotests, and promote greater transparency in politics by more accurately pinpointing \nwho said what, when. Thus, administrative and regulatory laws regarding AI can be \ndesigned to promote greater democratic participation or, if  ill-conceived, to reduce it.\nThis list is not exhaustive and focuses largely on domestic policy in the United \nStates, leaving out many areas of  law that AI is likely to touch. One lesson that \nmight be drawn concerns the growing disconnect between the context-specific way \nin which AI is governed today and a wider consideration of  themes shared by AI \ntechnologies across industries or sectors of  society . It could be tempting to create new \ninstitutional configurations capable of  amassing expertise and setting AI standards \nacross multiple contexts. The Study Panel’s consensus is that attempts to regulate “ AI” \nin general would be misguided, since there is no clear definition of  AI (it isn’t any \none thing), and the risks and considerations are very different in different domains. \nInstead, policymakers should recognize that to varying degrees and over time, various \nindustries will need distinct, appropriate, regulations that touch on software built \nusing AI or incorporating AI in some way . The government will need the expertise to \nscrutinize standards and technology developed by the private and public sector, and \nto craft regulations where necessary .\nGuidelines for the future\nFaced with the profound changes that AI technologies can produce, pressure for \n“more” and “tougher” regulation is inevitable. Misunderstanding about what AI is \nand is not, especially against a background of  scare-mongering, could fuel opposition \nto technologies that could benefit everyone. This would be a tragic mistake. \nRegulation that stifles innovation, or relocates it to other jurisdictions, would be \nsimilarly counterproductive.\nFortunately , principles that guide successful regulation of  current digital \ntechnologies can be instructive. A recent multi-year study comparing privacy \nregulation in four European countries and the United States, for example, yielded \ncounter-intuitive results.139 Those countries, such as Spain and France, with strict \nand detailed regulations bred a “compliance mentality” within corporations, which \nhad the effect of  discouraging both innovation and robust privacy protections. \nRather than taking responsibility for privacy protection internally and developing a \nprofessional staff to foster it in business and manufacturing processes, or engaging with \nprivacy advocates or academics outside their walls, these companies viewed privacy as \na compliance activity . Their focus was on avoiding fines or punishments, rather than \nproactively designing technology and adapting practices to protect privacy .\nBy contrast, the regulatory environment in the United States and Germany , \nwhich combined more ambiguous goals with tough transparency requirements and \nmeaningful enforcement, were more successful in catalyzing companies to view \n138  Political Bots, accessed August 1, 2016, http://politicalbots.org/.\n139  Kenneth A.

Broad legal mandates encouraged companies to \ndevelop a professional staff and processes to enforce privacy controls, engage with \noutside stakeholders, and to adapt their practices to technology advances. Requiring \ngreater transparency enabled civil society groups and media to become credible \nenforcers both in court and in the court of  public opinion, making privacy more \nsalient to corporate boards and leading them to further invest in privacy protection.\nIn AI, too, regulators can strengthen a virtuous cycle of  activity involving internal \nand external accountability , transparency , and professionalization, rather than narrow \ncompliance. As AI is integrated into cities, it will continue to challenge existing \nprotections for values such as privacy and accountability . Like other technologies, AI \nhas the potential to be used for good or nefarious purposes. This report has tried to \nhighlight the potential for both. A vigorous and informed debate about how to best \nsteer AI in ways that enrich our lives and our society , while encouraging creativity \nin the field, is an urgent and vital need. Policies should be evaluated as to whether \nthey democratically foster the development and equitable sharing of  AI’s benefits, \nor concentrate power and benefits in the hands of  a fortunate few . And since future \nAI technologies and their effects cannot be foreseen with perfect clarity , policies will \nneed to be continually re-evaluated in the context of  observed societal challenges and \nevidence from fielded systems.\nAs this report documents, significant AI-related advances have already had \nan impact on North American cities over the past fifteen years, and even more \nsubstantial developments will occur over the next fifteen. Recent advances are largely \ndue to the growth and analysis of  large data sets enabled by the Internet, advances \nin sensory technologies and, more recently , applications of  “deep learning.” In the \ncoming years, as the public encounters new AI applications in domains such as \ntransportation and healthcare, they must be introduced in ways that build trust and \nunderstanding, and respect human and civil rights. While encouraging innovation, \npolicies and processes should address ethical, privacy , and security implications, and \nshould work to ensure that the benefits of  AI technologies will be spread broadly and \nfairly . Doing so will be critical if  Artificial Intelligence research and its applications \nare to exert a positive influence on North American urban life in 2030 and beyond.\n\n50\nAPPENDIX I: A SHORT HISTORY OF AI\nThis Appendix is based primarily on Nilsson’s book140 and written from the prevalent \ncurrent perspective, which focuses on data intensive methods and big data. However \nimportant, this focus has not yet shown itself  to be the solution to all problems. A \ncomplete and fully balanced history of  the field is beyond the scope of  this document.\nThe field of  Artificial Intelligence (AI) was officially born and christened at a 1956 \nworkshop organized by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project \non Artificial Intelligence. The goal was to investigate ways in which machines could \nbe made to simulate aspects of  intelligence—the essential idea that has continued to \ndrive the field forward. McCarthy is credited with the first use of  the term “artificial \nintelligence” in the proposal he co-authored for the workshop with Marvin Minsky , \nNathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon.141 Many of  the people who attended soon \nled significant projects under the banner of  AI, including Arthur Samuel, Oliver \nSelfridge, Ray Solomonoff, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon.\nAlthough the Dartmouth workshop created a unified identity for the field and \na dedicated research community , many of  the technical ideas that have come to \ncharacterize AI existed much earlier. In the eighteenth century , Thomas Bayes \nprovided a framework for reasoning about the probability of  events.142 In the \nnineteenth century , George Boole showed that logical reasoning—dating back to \nAristotle—could be performed systematically in the same manner as solving a system \nof  equations.143 By the turn of  the twentieth century , progress in the experimental \nsciences had led to the emergence of  the field of  statistics,144 which enables \ninferences to be drawn rigorously from data. The idea of  physically engineering a \nmachine to execute sequences of  instructions, which had captured the imagination \nof  pioneers such as Charles Babbage, had matured by the 1950s, and resulted in the \nconstruction of  the first electronic computers.145 Primitive robots, which could \nsense and act autonomously , had also been built by that time.146\nThe most influential ideas underpinning computer science came from Alan Turing,  \nwho proposed a formal model of  computing. Turing’s classic essay , Computing Machinery \nand Intelligence,147 imagines the possibility of  computers created for simulating intelligence \nand explores many of  the ingredients now associated with AI, including how intelligence \nmight be tested, and how machines might automatically learn. Though these ideas \ninspired AI, Turing did not have access to the computing resources needed to \ntranslate his ideas into action.\nSeveral focal areas in the quest for AI emerged between the 1950s and the 1970s.148 \n140 Nilsson, The Quest for Artificial Intelligence.\n141  J.

The goal was to \ninvestigate ways in which \nmachines could be made \nto simulate aspects of \nintelligence—the essential \nidea that has continued to \ndrive the field forward.\n\n51\nNewell and Simon pioneered the foray into heuristic search, an efficient procedure \nfor finding solutions in large, combinatorial spaces. In particular, they applied this \nidea to construct proofs of  mathematical theorems, first through their Logic Theorist \nprogram, and then through the General Problem Solver.149 In the area of  computer \nvision, early work in character recognition by Selfridge and colleagues150 laid the \nbasis for more complex applications such as face recognition.151 By the late sixties, \nwork had also begun on natural language processing.152 “Shakey”, a wheeled \nrobot built at SRI International, launched the field of  mobile robotics. Samuel’s \nCheckers-playing program, which improved itself  through self-play , was one of  the \nfirst working instances of  a machine learning system.153 Rosenblatt’s Perceptron,154 \na computational model based on biological neurons, became the basis for the field \nof  artificial neural networks. Feigenbaum and others advocated 155the case for \nbuilding expert systems—knowledge repositories tailored for specialized domains \nsuch as chemistry and medical diagnosis.156\nEarly conceptual progress assumed the existence of  a symbolic system that could \nbe reasoned about and built upon. But by the 1980s, despite this promising headway \nmade into different aspects of  artificial intelligence, the field still could boast no \nsignificant practical successes. This gap between theory and practice arose in part from \nan insufficient emphasis within the AI community on grounding systems physically , with \ndirect access to environmental signals and data. There was also an overemphasis on \nBoolean (True/False) logic, overlooking the need to quantify uncertainty . The field \nwas forced to take cognizance of  these shortcomings in the mid-1980s, since interest \nin AI began to drop, and funding dried up. Nilsson calls this period the “ AI winter.”\nA much needed resurgence in the nineties built upon the idea that “Good Old-\nFashioned AI”157 was inadequate as an end-to-end approach to building intelligent \nsystems. Rather, intelligent systems needed to be built from the ground up, at all times \nsolving the task at hand, albeit with different degrees of  proficiency .158 Technological \nprogress had also made the task of  building systems driven by real-world data more \nfeasible. Cheaper and more reliable hardware for sensing and actuation made robots \neasier to build. Further, the Internet’s capacity for gathering large amounts of  data, \nand the availability of  computing power and storage to process that data, enabled \nstatistical techniques that, by design, derive solutions from data. These developments \nhave allowed AI to emerge in the past two decades as a profound influence on our \ndaily lives, as detailed in Section II. \n149  Allen Newell, John C Shaw , and Herbert A Simon, “Report on a general problem-solving \nprogram,” Proceedings of  the International Conference on Information Processing, UNESCO, Paris 15-20  \nJune 1959 (Unesco/Oldenbourg/Butterworths, 1960), 256–264.\n150  O.

As described \nin Section II, some of  them are currently “hotter” than others for various reasons. \nBut that is neither to minimize the historical importance of  the others, nor to say that \nthey may not re-emerge as hot areas in the future.\n• Search and Planning deal with reasoning about goal-directed behavior. Search \nplays a key role, for example, in chess-playing programs such as Deep Blue, in \ndeciding which move (behavior) will ultimately lead to a win (goal).\n• The area of  Knowledge Representation and Reasoning involves processing \ninformation (typically when in large amounts) into a structured form that can \nbe queried more reliably and efficiently . IBM’s Watson program, which beat \nhuman contenders to win the Jeopardy challenge in 2011, was largely based on \nan efficient scheme for organizing, indexing, and retrieving large amounts of  \ninformation gathered from various sources.159\n• Machine Learning is a paradigm that enables systems to automatically improve \ntheir performance at a task by observing relevant data. Indeed, machine \nlearning has been the key contributor to the AI surge in the past few decades, \nranging from search and product recommendation engines, to systems for \nspeech recognition, fraud detection, image understanding, and countless other \ntasks that once relied on human skill and judgment. The automation of  these \ntasks has enabled the scaling up of  services such as e-commerce.\n• As more and more intelligent systems get built, a natural question to consider \nis how such systems will interact with each other. The field of  Multi-Agent \nSystems considers this question, which is becoming increasingly important in \non-line marketplaces and transportation systems.\n• From its early days, AI has taken up the design and construction of  systems that \nare embodied in the real world. The area of  Robotics investigates fundamental \naspects of  sensing and acting—and especially their integration—that enable \na robot to behave effectively . Since robots and other computer systems share \nthe living world with human beings, the specialized subject of  Human Robot \nInteraction has also become prominent in recent decades.\n• Machine perception has always played a central role in AI, partly in developing \nrobotics, but also as a completely independent area of  study . The most commonly \nstudied perception modalities are Computer Vision and Natural Language \nProcessing, each of  which is attended to by large and vibrant communities.\n• Several other focus areas within AI today are consequences of  the growth of  the  \nInternet. Social Network Analysis investigates the effect of  neighborhood relations \nin influencing the behavior of  individuals and communities. Crowdsourcing is \nyet another innovative problem-solving technique, which relies on harnessing \nhuman intelligence (typically from thousands of  humans) to solve hard \ncomputational problems.\nAlthough the separation of  AI into sub-fields has enabled deep technical progress \nalong several different fronts, synthesizing intelligence at any reasonable scale invariably \nrequires many different ideas to be integrated. For example, the AlphaGo program160 161 \nthat recently defeated the current human champion at the game of  Go used multiple \nmachine learning algorithms for training itself, and also used a sophisticated search \nprocedure while playing the game.\n159  David A.

The Standing Committee defined a Study Panel charge for the \ninaugural Study Panel in the summer of  2015 and recruited Professor Peter Stone, \nat the University of  Texas at Austin, to chair the panel. The seventeen-member \nStudy Panel, comprised of  experts in AI from academia, corporate laboratories \nand industry , and AI-savvy scholars in law , political science, policy , and economics, \nwas launched in mid-fall 2015. The participants represent diverse specialties and \ngeographic regions, genders, and career stages. \nThe Standing Committee extensively discussed ways to frame the Study Panel \ncharge to consider both recent advances in AI and potential societal impacts on jobs, \nthe environment, transportation, public safety , healthcare, community engagement, \nand government. The committee considered various ways to focus the study , \nincluding surveying subfields and their status, examining a particular technology \nsuch as machine learning or natural language processing, and studying particular \napplication areas such as healthcare or transportation. The committee ultimately \nchose a thematic focus on “ AI and Life in 2030” to recognize that AI’s various uses \nand impacts will not occur independently of  one another, or of  a multitude of  other \nsocietal and technological developments. Acknowledging the central role cities have \nplayed throughout most of  human experience, the focus was narrowed to the large \nurban areas where most people live.

inspired by—but typically operate quite differently from—the ways people use \ntheir nervous systems and bodies to sense, learn, reason, and take action. While the \nrate of  progress in AI has been patchy and unpredictable, there have been significant \nadvances since the field’s inception sixty years ago. Once a mostly academic area of   \nstudy , twenty-first century AI enables a constellation of  mainstream technologies that  \nare having a substantial impact on everyday lives. Computer vision and AI planning, \nfor example, drive the video games that are now a bigger entertainment industry than  \nHollywood. Deep learning, a form of  machine learning based on layered representations \nof  variables referred to as neural networks, has made speech-understanding practical \non our phones and in our kitchens, and its algorithms can be applied widely to an \narray of  applications that rely on pattern recognition. Natural Language Processing \n(NLP) and knowledge representation and reasoning have enabled a machine to beat \nthe Jeopardy champion and are bringing new power to Web searches. \nWhile impressive, these technologies are highly tailored to particular tasks. Each \napplication typically requires years of  specialized research and careful, unique \nconstruction. In similarly targeted applications, substantial increases in the future \nuses of  AI technologies, including more self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics \nand targeted treatments, and physical assistance for elder care can be expected.

communities, and \nbudding efforts are promising. Using data mining and machine learning, for example, \nAI has been used to create predictive models to help government agencies address \nissues such as prevention of  lead poisoning in at-risk children and distribution of   \nfood efficiently . These budding efforts suggest more could be done, particularly if   \nagencies and organizations can engage and build trust with these communities. \nGaining public trust is also a challenge for AI use by Public Safety and Security \nprofessionals. North American cities and federal agencies have already begun to \ndeploy AI technologies in border administration and law enforcement. By 2030,  \nthey will rely heavily upon them, including improved cameras and drones for \nsurveillance, algorithms to detect financial fraud, and predictive policing. The latter \nraises the specter of  innocent people being unjustifiably monitored, and care must be \ntaken to avoid systematizing human bias and to protect civil liberties. Well-deployed \nAI prediction tools have the potential to provide new kinds of  transparency about \ndata and inferences, and may be applied to detect, remove, or reduce human bias, \nrather than reinforcing it.\nSocial and political decisions are likewise at play in AI’s influences on \nEmployment and Workplace trends, such as the safety nets needed to protect \npeople from structural changes in the economy . AI is poised to replace people in \ncertain kinds of  jobs, such as in the driving of  taxis and trucks. However, in many \nrealms, AI will likely replace tasks rather than jobs in the near term, and will also \ncreate new kinds of  jobs. But the new jobs that will emerge are harder to imagine in  \nadvance than the existing jobs that will likely be lost. AI will also lower the cost of  \nmany goods and services, effectively making everyone better off. Longer term, AI may  \nbe thought of  as a radically different mechanism for wealth creation in which everyone \nshould be entitled to a portion of  the world’s AI-produced treasures. It is not too soon \nfor social debate on how the economic fruits of  AI technologies should be shared.\nEntertainment has been transformed by social networks and other platforms for  \nsharing and browsing blogs, videos, and photos, which rely on techniques actively \ndeveloped in NLP , information retrieval, image processing, crowdsourcing, and machine \nlearning. Some traditional sources of  entertainment have also embraced AI to compose \nmusic, create stage performances, and even to generate 3D scenes from natural \nlanguage text. The enthusiasm with which people have already responded to AI-driven  \nentertainment has been surprising. As with many aspects of  AI, there is ongoing debate \nabout the extent to which the technology replaces or enhances sociability . AI will \nincreasingly enable entertainment that is more interactive, personalized, and engaging. \nResearch should be directed toward understanding how to leverage these attributes \nfor individuals’ and society’s benefit. \nWhat’s next for AI research?\nThe research that fuels the AI revolution has also seen rapid changes. Foremost \namong them is the maturation of  machine learning, stimulated in part by the rise of  \nthe digital economy , which both provides and leverages large amounts of  data.

on collaborative systems investigates models and algorithms to help \ndevelop autonomous systems that can work collaboratively with other systems and \nwith humans. This research relies on developing formal models of  collaboration, \nand studies the capabilities needed for systems to become effective partners. There \nis growing interest in applications that can utilize the complementary strengths of  \nhumans and machines—for humans to help AI systems to overcome their limitations, \nand for agents to augment human abilities and activities.\nCrowdsourcing and human computation\nSince human abilities are superior to automated methods for accomplishing many \ntasks, research on crowdsourcing and human computation investigates methods to  \naugment computer systems by utilizing human intelligence to solve problems that  \ncomputers alone cannot solve well. Introduced only about fifteen years ago, this \nresearch now has an established presence in AI. The best-known example of  \ncrowdsourcing is Wikipedia, a knowledge repository that is maintained and updated \nby netizens and that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such \nas encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth. Crowdsourcing focuses on \ndevising innovative ways to harness human intelligence. Citizen science platforms \nenergize volunteers to solve scientific problems, while paid crowdsourcing platforms \nsuch as Amazon Mechanical Turk provide automated access to human intelligence on \ndemand. Work in this area has facilitated advances in other subfields of  AI, including \ncomputer vision and NLP , by enabling large amounts of  labeled training data and/or \nhuman interaction data to be collected in a short amount of  time. Current research \nefforts explore ideal divisions of  tasks between humans and machines based on their \ndiffering capabilities and costs. \nAlgorithmic game theory and computational social choice\nNew attention is being drawn to the economic and social computing dimensions of  \nAI, including incentive structures. Distributed AI and multi-agent systems have been \nstudied since the early 1980s, gained prominence starting in the late 1990s, and were \naccelerated by the internet. A natural requirement is that systems handle potentially \nmisaligned incentives, including self-interested human participants or firms, as well \nas automated AI-based agents representing them. Topics receiving attention include \ncomputational mechanism design (an economic theory of  incentive design, seeking \nincentive-compatible systems where inputs are truthfully reported), computational \nsocial choice (a theory for how to aggregate rank orders on alternatives), incentive \naligned information elicitation (prediction markets, scoring rules, peer prediction) and \nalgorithmic game theory (the equilibria of  markets, network games, and parlor games \nsuch as Poker—a game where significant advances have been made in recent years \nthrough abstraction techniques and no-regret learning).\nInternet of Things (IoT)\nA growing body of  research is devoted to the idea that a wide array of  devices can \nbe interconnected to collect and share their sensory information. Such devices can \ninclude appliances, vehicles, buildings, cameras, and other things. While it’s a matter \nof  technology and wireless networking to connect the devices, AI can process and \nuse the resulting huge amounts of  data for intelligent and useful purposes. Currently , \nthese devices use a bewildering array of  incompatible communication protocols. AI \ncould help tame this Tower of  Babel.\nNeuromorphic Computing\nTraditional computers implement the von Neumann model of  computing, which \nseparates the modules for input/output, instruction-processing, and memory .

During the first \nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) “grand challenge” on \nautonomous driving in 2004, research teams failed to complete the challenge in a \nlimited desert setting.\nBut in eight short years, from 2004-2012, speedy and surprising progress occurred \nin both academia and industry . Advances in sensing technology and machine learning \nfor perception tasks has sped progress and, as a result, Google’s autonomous vehicles \nand Tesla’s semi-autonomous cars are driving on city streets today . Google’s self-\ndriving cars, which have logged more than 1,500,000 miles (300,000 miles without an \naccident),33 are completely autonomous—no human input needed. Tesla has widely \nreleased self-driving capability to existing cars with a software update.34 Their cars are \nsemi-autonomous, with human drivers expected to stay engaged and take over if  they \ndetect a potential problem. It is not yet clear whether this semi-autonomous approach \nis sustainable, since as people become more confident in the cars’ capabilities, they \nare likely to pay less attention to the road, and become less reliable when they are \nmost needed. The first traffic fatality involving an autonomous car, which occurred in \nJune of  2016, brought this question into sharper focus.35\nIn the near future, sensing algorithms will achieve super-human performance for \ncapabilities required for driving. Automated perception, including vision, is already \nnear or at human-level performance for well-defined tasks such as recognition and \ntracking. Advances in perception will be followed by algorithmic improvements  \nin higher level reasoning capabilities such as planning. A recent report predicts \nself-driving cars to be widely adopted by 2020.36 And the adoption of  self-driving \ncapabilities won’t be limited to personal transportation.

Incentives provided by the Affordable Care Act \nhave accelerated the penetration of  electronic health records (EHRs) into clinical \npractice, but implementation has been poor, eroding clinicians’ confidence in their \nusefulness. A small group of  companies control the EHR market, and user interfaces \nare widely considered substandard, including annoying pop-ups that physicians \nroutinely dismiss. The promise of  new analytics using data from EHRs, including AI, \nremains largely unrealized due to these and other regulatory and structural barriers.\nLooking ahead to the next fifteen years, AI advances, if  coupled with sufficient data  \nand well-targeted systems, promise to change the cognitive tasks assigned to human \nclinicians. Physicians now routinely solicit verbal descriptions of  symptoms from \npresenting patients and, in their heads, correlate patterns against the clinical \npresentation of  known diseases. With automated assistance, the physician could \ninstead supervise this process, applying her or his experience and intuition to guide the \ninput process and to evaluate the output of  the machine intelligence. The literal \n“hands-on” experience of  the physician will remain critical. A significant challenge is to \noptimally integrate the human dimensions of  care with automated reasoning processes.\nTo achieve future advances, clinicians must be involved and engaged at the outset to \nensure that systems are well-engineered and trusted. Already , a new generation of  more \ntech savvy physicians routinely utilize specialized apps on mobile devices. At the same \ntime, workloads on primary care clinicians have increased to the point that they are  \ngrateful for help from any quarter. Thus, the opportunity to exploit new learning methods,  \nto create structured patterns of  inference by mining the scientific literature automatically ,  \nand to create true cognitive assistants by supporting free-form dialogue, has never \nbeen greater. Provided these advances are not stymied by regulatory , legal, and social \nbarriers, immense improvements to the value of  healthcare are within our grasp.\nHealthcare analytics\nAt the population level, AI’s ability to mine outcomes from millions of  patient clinical \nrecords promises to enable finer-grained, more personalized diagnosis and treatment. \nAutomated discovery of  genotype-phenotype connections will also become possible \nas full, once-in-a-lifetime genome sequencing becomes routine for each patient.\nA related (and perhaps earlier) capability will be to find “patients like mine” as a way  \nto inform treatment decisions based on analysis of  a similar cohort.

In the past fifteen years, employment \nhas shifted due to a major recession and increasing globalization, particularly with \nChina’s introduction to the world economy , as well as enormous changes in non-AI \ndigital technology . Since the 1990s, the US has experienced continued growth in \nproductivity and GDP , but median income has stagnated and the employment to \npopulation ratio has fallen.\nThere are clear examples of  industries in which digital technologies have had \nprofound impacts, good and bad, and other sectors in which automation will likely \nmake major changes in the near future. Many of  these changes have been driven \nstrongly by “routine” digital technologies, including enterprise resource planning, \nnetworking, information processing, and search.

To date, digital technologies have been affecting workers more in the \nskilled middle, such as travel agents, rather than the very lowest-skilled or highest \nskilled work.110 On the other hand, the spectrum of  tasks that digital systems can \ndo is evolving as AI systems improve, which is likely to gradually increase the scope \nof  what is considered routine.

\ntheir daily lives without it. Powered by AI, the internet has established user-generated \ncontent as a viable source of  information and entertainment. Social networks such \nas Facebook are now pervasive, and they function as personalized channels of  \nsocial interaction and entertainment—sometimes to the detriment of  interpersonal \ninteraction. Apps such as WhatsApp and Snapchat enable smart-phone users to \nremain constantly “in touch” with peers and share sources of  entertainment and \ninformation. In on-line communities such as Second Life and role-playing games such \nas World of  Warcraft, people imagine an alternative existence in a virtual world.115 \nSpecialized devices, such as Amazon’s Kindle have also redefined the essentials of  \nlong-cherished pastimes. Books can now be browsed and procured with a few swipes \nof  the finger, stored by the thousands in a pocket-sized device, and read in much the \nsame way as a handheld paperback.\nTrusted platforms now exist for sharing and browsing blogs, videos, photos, and \ntopical discussions, in addition to a variety of  other user-generated information. To \noperate at the scale of  the internet, these platforms must rely on techniques that are \nbeing actively developed in natural language processing, information retrieval, image \nprocessing, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Algorithms such as collaborative \nfiltering have been developed, for example, to recommend relevant movies, songs, or \narticles based on the user’s demographic details and browsing history .116\nTraditional sources of  entertainment have also embraced AI to keep pace with the  \ntimes. As exemplified in the book and movie Moneyball, professional sport is now subjected \nto intensive quantitative analysis.117 Beyond aggregate performance statistics, on-field \nsignals can be monitored using sophisticated sensors and cameras. Software has been \ncreated for composing music118 and recognizing soundtracks.119 Techniques from computer \nvision and NLP have been used in creating stage performances.120 Even the lay user can \nexercise his or her creativity on platforms such as WordsEye, which automatically \ngenerates 3D scenes from natural language text.121 AI has also come to the aid of  \nhistorical research in the arts, and is used extensively in stylometry and, more recently , \nin the analysis of  paintings.122\nThe enthusiasm with which humans have responded to AI-driven entertainment \nhas been surprising and led to concerns that it reduces interpersonal interaction \namong human beings. Few predicted that people would spend hours on end \ninteracting with a display .

human actors become less responsible for the \nactions of  a machine.\nLiability (criminal)\nIf  tort law expects harms to be foreseeable, criminal law goes further to expect that \nharms be intended. US law in particular attaches great importance to the concept of  \nmens rea—the intending mind. As AI applications engage in behavior that, were it \ndone by a human, would constitute a crime, courts and other legal actors will have to \npuzzle through whom to hold accountable and on what theory .\nAgency\nThe above issues raise the question of  whether and under what circumstances an \nAI system could operate as the agent of  a person or corporation. Already regulatory \nbodies in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere are setting the conditions under \nwhich software can enter into a binding contract.135 The more AI conducts legally \nsalient activities, the greater the challenge to principles of  agency under the law .\nCertification\nThe very notion of  “artificial intelligence” suggests a substitution for human skill \nand ingenuity . And in many contexts, ranging from driving to performing surgery or \npracticing law , a human must attain some certification or license before performing \na given task. Accordingly , law and policy will have to—and already does—grapple \nwith how to determine competency in an AI system. For example, imagine a \nrobotics company creates a surgical platform capable of  autonomously removing an \nappendix. Or imagine a law firm writes an application capable of  rendering legal \nadvice. Today , it is unclear from a legal perspective who in this picture would have to \npass the medical boards or legal bar, let alone where they would be required to do so.136\nLabor\nAs AI substitutes for human roles, some jobs will be eliminated and new jobs will \nbe created. The net effect on jobs is ambiguous, but labor markets are unlikely to \nbenefit everyone evenly . The demand for some types of  skills or abilities will likely \ndrop significantly , negatively affecting the employment levels and wages of  people \nwith those skills.137 While the ultimate effects on income levels and distribution are not \ninevitable, they depend substantially on government policies, on the way companies \nchoose to organize work, and on decisions by individuals to invest in learning new \nskills and seeking new types of  work and income opportunities. People who find their \nemployment altered or terminated as a consequence of  advances of  AI may seek \nrecourse in the legislature and courts. This may be why Littler Mendelson LLP—\nperhaps the largest employment law firm in the world—has an entire practice group \nto address robotics and artificial intelligence.\nTaxation\nFederal, state, and local revenue sources may be affected. Accomplishing a task using AI \ninstead of  a person can be faster and more accurate—and avoid employment taxes.  \nAs a result, AI applications could increasingly shift investment from payroll and \nincome to capital expenditure. Depending on a state budget’s reliance on payroll \nand income tax, such a shift could be destabilizing. AI may also display different \n135  Ian R.

In particular, they applied this \nidea to construct proofs of  mathematical theorems, first through their Logic Theorist \nprogram, and then through the General Problem Solver.149 In the area of  computer \nvision, early work in character recognition by Selfridge and colleagues150 laid the \nbasis for more complex applications such as face recognition.151 By the late sixties, \nwork had also begun on natural language processing.152 “Shakey”, a wheeled \nrobot built at SRI International, launched the field of  mobile robotics. Samuel’s \nCheckers-playing program, which improved itself  through self-play , was one of  the \nfirst working instances of  a machine learning system.153 Rosenblatt’s Perceptron,154 \na computational model based on biological neurons, became the basis for the field \nof  artificial neural networks. Feigenbaum and others advocated 155the case for \nbuilding expert systems—knowledge repositories tailored for specialized domains \nsuch as chemistry and medical diagnosis.156\nEarly conceptual progress assumed the existence of  a symbolic system that could \nbe reasoned about and built upon. But by the 1980s, despite this promising headway \nmade into different aspects of  artificial intelligence, the field still could boast no \nsignificant practical successes. This gap between theory and practice arose in part from \nan insufficient emphasis within the AI community on grounding systems physically , with \ndirect access to environmental signals and data. There was also an overemphasis on \nBoolean (True/False) logic, overlooking the need to quantify uncertainty .
