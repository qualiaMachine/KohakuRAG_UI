Finally, we propose a health-informed computing framework that explicitly\nincorporates public health risk as a key metric for scheduling data center workloads across space and time,\nwhich can effectively mitigate adverse health impacts while advancing environmental sustainability. More\nbroadly, we also recommend adopting a standard reporting protocol for the public health impacts of data\ncenters and paying attention to all impacted communities.\n1 Introduction\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has numerous potentials to play a transformative role in address-\ning grand societal challenges, including air quality and public health [1, 2]. For example, by integrating\nmultimodal data from various sources, AI can provide effective tools and actionable insights for pandemic\npreparedness, disease prevention, healthcare optimization, and air quality management [1, 3]. However,\nthe surging demand for AI — particularly generative AI, as exemplified by the recent popularity of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) — has driven a rapid increase in computational needs, fueling the unprecedented\nexpansion of energy-intensive data centers. According to the recent Lawrence Berkeley National Lab re-\nport [4], AI training and inference are projected to become the dominant workloads and push the U.S. data\ncenter electricity consumption to account for 6.7–12.0% of the national total in 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.\nThe growing electricity demand of data centers has not only created significant stress on power grid\nstability [5,6], but also increasingly impacts the environment through escalating carbon emissions [7,8] and\nwater consumption [9]. These environmental impacts are driven primarily by the “expansion of AI products\nand services,” as recently acknowledged by technology companies in their sustainability reports [10]. To\nmitigate the challenges posed to both power grids and the environment, a range of strategies have been\nexplored, including grid-integrated data centers [6, 11], energy-efficient hardware and software [12–14],\nand the adoption of carbon-aware and water-efficient computing practices [9,15–17], among others.\nThe hidden toll of data centers.While the environmental footprint of data centers has garnered atten-\ntion, the public health burden, a hidden toll of data centers, has been largely overlooked. Across its entire\nlifecycle — from chip manufacturing to operation — a data center contributes substantially to air quality\ndegradation and public health costs through the emission of various criteria air pollutants. These include\nfine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles measuring 2.5 micrometers or smaller in diameter that can penetrate\n1 Yuelin Han and Zhifeng Wu contributed equally and are listed alphabetically.\nCorresponding authors: Adam Wierman (adamw@caltech.edu) and Shaolei Ren (shaolei@ucr.edu)\n1\narXiv:2412.06288v2  [cs.CY]  23 Oct 2025\n\ndeep into lungs and cause serious health effects), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Con-\ncretely, the server manufacturing process [18], electricity generation from fossil fuels to power data centers,\nand the maintenance and usage of diesel backup generators to ensure continuous data center operation\nall produce significant amounts of criteria air pollutants. Moreover, the distinct spatial-temporal hetero-\ngeneities of emission sources suggest that focusing solely on reducing data centers’ carbon footprints may\nnot minimize its emissions of criteria air pollutants or the resulting public health impacts (Section 6.2).\nExposure to criteria air pollutants is directly and causally linked to various adverse health outcomes,2 in-\ncluding premature mortality, lung cancer, asthma, heart attacks, cardiovascular diseases, and even cognitive\ndecline, especially for the elderly and vulnerable individuals with pre-existing conditions [20–22]. More-\nover, even short-term (hours to days) PM2.5 exposure is harmful and deadly, accounting for approximately\n1 million premature deaths per year from 2000 to 2019 and representing 2% of total global deaths [23].\nCriteria air pollutants are not confined to the immediate vicinity of their emission sources; they can travel\nhundreds of miles through a dispersion process (i.e., cross-state air pollution) [24, 25], impacting public\nhealth across vast regions. Further, PM 2.5 is considered “non-threshold,” i.e., there is no absolutely safe\nexposure level [26]. Thus, compliance with the national/regional air quality standards does not necessarily\nensure the air is healthy.\nGlobally, 4.2 million deaths were attributed to ambient (i.e., outdoor) air pollution in 2019 [27]. Air\npollution has become the second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases [28]. Notably, according\nto the latest Global Burden of Disease report [29], along with high blood pressure and high blood sugar,\nambient particulate matter is placed among the leading risk factors for disease burden globally in every\nsocio-demographic group.\nImportantly, along with transportation and industrial activities, electricity generation is a key contributor\nto ambient air pollution with substantial public health impacts [28,30,31]. For example, a recent study [32]\nshows that, between 1999 and 2020, a total of 460,000excessdeaths were attributed to PM2.5 generated by coal-\nfired power plants alone in the U.S. As highlighted by the U.S. EPA [30], despite years of progress, power\nplants “remain a leading source of air, water, and land pollution that affects communities nationwide.” In\nEurope, the public health cost of air pollution from power plants is valued at approximately 1% of the gross\ndomestic product (GDP), according to the European Environment Agency’s study in 2024 [33].\nThe public health outcomes of data centers due to their emission of criteria air pollutants lead to various\nlosses, such as hospitalizations, medication usage, emergency room visits, school loss days, and lost work-\ndays. Nonetheless, despite recent policy efforts [34, 35], the tangible and growing public health impacts\nof data centers have remained under the radar, almost entirely omitted from today’s risk assessments and\nsustainability reports [10,36,37].\nQuantifying and addressing the public health impacts of data centers.In this paper, we uncover and\nquantify the hidden public health impacts of data centers. We introduce a principled methodology to model\nthe emission of criteria air pollutants associated with a computing task and data center across three distinct\nscopes: emissions from the maintenance and operation of backup generators (Scope 1), emissions from\nfossil fuel combustion for electricity generation (Scope 2), and emissions resulting from the manufacturing\nof server hardware (Scope 3). Then, we analyze the dispersion of criteria air pollutants and the resulting\npublic health impacts.\nAs the U.S. hosts nearly half of the world’s data centers [38] and the EPA data excludes other regions [39],\nour empirical study focuses on the 48 contiguous U.S. states plus Washington D.C.3 Our main results (Sec-\ntion 5) focus on the scope-1 and scope-2 health impacts of U.S. data centers and, specifically, LLM train-\ning. Using the reduced-complexity modeling tool COBRA (CO-Benefits Risk Assessment) provided by the\nEPA [39], our analysis demonstrates that driven by the growing demand for AI, the U.S. data centers could\ncontribute to, among others, approximately 600,000 asthma symptom cases and 1,300 premature deaths in\n2028, exceeding 1/3 of asthma deaths in the U.S. each year [40]. The overall public health costs could reach\nmore than$20 billion, rival or even top those of on-road emissions of the largest U.S. states such as California\n2While we focus on public health, we note that the impacts of criteria air pollutants extend beyond humans and include harms to\nenvironmentally sensitive areas, such as some national parks and wilderness areas which, classified as “Class 1 areas” under the Clean\nAir Act, require special air protection [19].\n3If located in countries with higher population densities, more pollutant-intensive electricity mixes, or less stringent air quality\nstandards, the same data centers would likely lead to more premature deaths and other adverse health impacts than in the U.S. We\nrecommend further research on the public health impact of non-U.S. data centers.\n2\n\nwith∼35 million registered vehicles [41]. Moreover, depending on the location, training an AI model of the\nLlama-3.1 scale can produce an amount of air pollutants equivalent to driving a car for more than 10,000\nround trips between Los Angeles and New York City (LA-NYC), resulting in a health cost that even exceeds\n120% of the training electricity cost.\nImportantly, although the public health impact of data centers may be modest at the national level, it\nis geographically concentrated, with certain regions and communities bearing a disproportionate share.\nIn particular, some low-income counties experience significantly greater health costs, with per-household\nburdens exceeding those in other counties by more than 200-fold.\nFurthermore, to highlight scope-1 health impacts, we examine data center backup generators in Virginia,\nwhich hosts one of the largest concentrations of data centers in the world [42]. Our analysis shows that,\nassuming the actual emissions are only 10% of the permitted level based on the historical reports and future\nprojections [42–44], the data center backup generators registered in Virginia (mostly in Loudoun, Prince\nWilliam, and Fairfax) could already cause 14,000 asthma symptom cases among other health outcomes and\na total public health burden of$220-300 million per year, impacting residents in multiple surrounding states\nand as far as Florida (Section 3.1). If these data centers emit air pollutants at the maximum permitted level,\nthe total public health cost will become 10-fold and reach$2.2-3.0 billion per year.\nTo address the growing and uneven distribution of health burdens, we propose health-informed com-\nputing that explicitly incorporates the public health risk as a key metric when scheduling data center work-\nloads. Specifically, by exploiting the spatial-temporal variations of public health impacts and using spatial\nload shifting as a case study, we demonstrate that the health-informed approach can significantly reduce\nthe health cost compared to the baseline, while continuing to offer meaningful electricity cost savings and\nreductions in carbon emissions.\nFinally, we provide broader recommendations to address the increasing public health impact of data\ncenters (Section 7). We recommend technology companies adopt a standard reporting protocol for criteria\nair pollutants and public health impacts in their AI model cards and sustainability reports and pay attention\nto all impacted communities.\nTo summarize, wile AI and data centers offer many societal benefits, our study sheds light on, quantifies,\nand addresses the often overlooked negative externalities of their resource demand, particularly the public\nhealth impact. We also urge further research to comprehensively address the public health implications\nwhen developing data centers in the future, ensuring that the growth of data centers does not exacerbate\nthe health burden.\nDisclaimer.The results presented in this paper are not intended to encourage or discourage the construction\nof data centers, nor should they be used to support or oppose any specific project, which requires more detailed and\ncontext-specific evaluation. We do not take a position on decisions related to any specific data centers or the use of AI,\nbut instead provide a quantitative assessment of the potential public health impacts of the data center industry.\n2 Background on Air Pollutants\nThis section provides background on criteria air pollutants and U.S. air quality policies. Other countries\nhave similar policies in place to safeguard public health, although their levels of enforcement strictness\noften differ [33].\nCriteria air pollutants, including PM 2.5, SO2 and NO2, are a group of airborne contaminants that are\nemitted from various sources such as industrial activities and vehicle emissions. The direct emission of\nPM2.5 is called primary PM2.5, while precursor pollutants such as SO2, NOx, and VOCs, can form secondary\nPM2.5 and/or ozones [45]. These air pollutants can travel a long distance (a.k.a. cross-state air pollution),\nposing direct and significant risks to public health over large areas, particularly for vulnerable populations\nincluding the elderly and individuals with respiratory conditions [24,25].\nLong-term exposure to PM 2.5, even at a low level, are directly linked to numerous health outcomes,\nincluding premature mortality, heart attacks, asthma, stroke, lung cancer, and even cognitive decline [21,22].\nThese health effects result in various losses, such as hospitalizations, medication usage, emergency room\nvisits, school loss days, and lost workdays, which can be further quantified in economic costs based on\npublic health research for various health endpoints [46]. In addition, short-term (hours to days) PM 2.5\nexposure is also dangerous, contributing to approximately 1 million premature deaths per year globally\nfrom 2000 to 2019 [23].\n3\n\nFigure 1:The overview of data centers’ contribution to air pollutants and public health impacts. Scope-1 and scope-2\nimpacts occur during the operation of data centers (“operational”), whereas scope-3 impacts arise from activities across\nthe supply chain (“embodied”).\nUnder the Clean Air Act, the U.S. EPA is authorized to regulate the emission levels of criteria air pollu-\ntants, reducing concentrations to comply with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) [47].\nFor example, the NAAQS primary standards set the annual average PM 2.5 concentration at 9µg/m 3 and\nthe 98-th percentile of 1-hour daily maximum NO2 concentration at 100 parts per billion by volume, both\ncounted over three years [48]. In addition, state and local governments may set additional regulations on\ncriteria air pollutants to strengthen or reinforce national standards [49].\nWhile the U.S. has generally better air quality than many other countries, 4 in 10 people in the U.S.\nstill live with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the “State of the Air 2024” report published\nby the American Lung Association [50]. In 2019 (the latest year of data provided by the World Health\nOrganization, or WHO, as of November 2024), an estimate of 93,886 deaths in the U.S. were attributed to\nambient air pollution [51]. In fact, the EPA’s recently tightened standard for PM2.5 sets an annual average\nlimit of 9µg/m 3, considerably higher than the WHO’s recommended level of 5µg/m3 [48, 52]. Moreover,\nthe EPA projects that 53 U.S. counties, including 23 in the already most populous state of California, would\nfail to meet the revised national annual PM2.5 standard in 2032 [53].\nAlthough CO2 is broadly classified by the EPA as an air pollutant following the U.S. Supreme Court\nruling in 2007 [54] and contributes to long-term climate change, it often does not cause the same immediate\nhealth impacts as criteria pollutants [55]. In the U.S., CO2 and other greenhouse gases are subject to different\nEPA regulations from those for criteria air pollutants. Thus, for the sake of presentation in this paper, we\nuse “air pollutants” to solely refer to criteria air pollutants wherever applicable.\n3 Data Centers’ Contribution to Air Pollutants\nThis section presents an overview of data centers’ impact on air quality and contribution to criteria air pol-\nlutants throughout its lifecycle across three scopes (Fig. 1). The scoping definition in this paper parallels\nthe well-established greenhouse gas protocol [56]. Specifically, scope-1 and scope-2 air pollutants primarily\noriginate from onsite generators and power plants, collectively referred to as operational emissions, while\nscope-3 pollutants arise from the supply chain and are referred to as embodied emissions.\n3.1 Scope 1: Onsite Generator\nWhile the construction phase of a data center directly increases air pollutant emissions, its amortized health\nimpact over a typical 15–20 year lifespan is negligible. Therefore, we focus on onsite backup generators as\nthe primary source of scope-1 direct air pollutants.\nData centers are mission-critical facilities that are designed to operate with high availability and uptime\nguarantees. As a result, to maintain operation during emergencies such as grid outages, data centers require\nhighly reliable backup power sources [10, 37]. Diesel generators are known to emit significant amounts of\nair pollutants and even hazardous emissions during operation [57]. For example, they emit 200-600 times\nmore NOx than new or controlled existing natural gas-fired power plants for each unit of electricity produced\n[58]. Moreover, capacity redundancy is typically followed for diesel generator installations to ensure high\navailability [59]. Nonetheless, there is limited practical experience with cleaner backup alternatives that\n4\n\n[Image page=4 idx=1 name=Im1.png] Size: 2889x773, Data: 493167 bytes\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPercentile\n(a)Health cost map\n101 102 103 104 105 106 107\nHealth Cost (US $)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0CDF (b)CDF of county-wide health cost\nState County Health Cost\n(million$)\nMD Montgomery 19.9(17.3, 22.4)\nV A Fairfax 18.9(16.6, 21.2)\nMD Prince Georges 8.9(7.5, 10.4)\nMD Baltimore 8.3(7.0, 9.6)\nDC District of Columbia 7.6(6.2, 9.0)\nMD Anne Arundel 6.3(5.5, 7.2)\nMD Baltimore City 6.0(4.8, 7.1)\nV A Loudoun 5.4(4.7, 6.1)\nV A Prince William 5.0(4.4, 5.7)\nMD Frederick 4.6(3.9, 5.2)\n(c)Top-10 counties by health cost\nFigure 2:The county-level total scope-1 health cost of data center backup generators operated in Virginia (mostly in\nLoudoun County, Fairfax County, and Prince William County) [62]. The backup generators are assumed to emit air\npollutants at 10% of the permitted levels per year. The total annual public health cost is$220-300 million, including\n$190-260 million incurred in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and\nWashington D.C.

(c) Top-10 counties by the total health cost.\ncan provide comparable reliability at scale in real-world settings in the near term, as highlighted by the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy in its recent recommendations regarding AI data center infrastructures [6].\nConsequently, the vast majority of data centers, even including those newly built by major technology\ncompanies, depend on onsite diesel generators for backup power [6,60]. For example, in Northern Virginia\n(mostly in Loudoun, Prince William, and Fairfax), the number of permits for data center diesel generators\nhas increased by more than 70% since 2023 compared to the total number of permits issued between 2000 and\n2022 [60]. Importantly, nearly all the diesel generators are Tier 2, which have significantly higher emission\nrates than Tier 4 units [60, 61]. The total permitted annual emission limits for these diesel generators are\napproximately 13,000 tons of NOx, 1,400 tons of VOCs, 50 tons of SO2, and 600 tons of PM2.5, all in U.S. short\ntons.\nWhile diesel generators need to comply with air quality regulations and typically do not operate over\nextended periods of time, regular maintenance and testing are essential to ensure their operational reliabil-\nity. A recent report by the state of Virginia [42] found that the actual air pollutant emissions from backup\ngenerators at Virginia’s data centers reached approximately 7% of the total permitted amounts in 2023, pri-\nmarily for maintenance. Likewise, the actual emissions took up 3% to 12% of the permitted levels for some\ndata centers in Quincy, Washington [43].\nMoreover, the U.S. EPA recently issued a clarification that would allow data centers to run backup gen-\nerators for up to 50 hours a year (or roughly 10% of the permits that typically allow 500 hours per year) to\nparticipate in demand response—a program designed to reduce grid demand during peak hours, which is\nincreasingly activated as surging data center demand strains grid capacity [44]. This trend may necessitate\nextended reliance on backup generators [6]. What further adds to the public health impact is that many\ndata center generators in a region may operate simultaneously for demand response during grid capacity\nshortages, potentially resulting in a short-term spike in PM2.5 and NOx emissions that can be particularly\nharmful [6, 23, 48]. For example, from June 23 to 25, 2025, some data centers in Loudoun County, Virginia,\nwere instructed to run their on-site diesel generators for demand response, releasing large amounts of air\npollutants and “black smoke” [61].\nThe high emission rate from onsite generators, combined with extended operation for maintenance and\ndemand response beyond grid outages, could pose serious health risks, especially in regions with a con-\ncentration of large data centers. To illustrate this point, we consider the data centers’ onsite generators in\nVirginia. Assuming that the actual emissions are 10% of the permitted level as a reference case that re-\nflects both the historical reports and future demand response projections [42–44],4 the backup generators\ncould already cause 14,000 asthma symptom cases and 13-19 deaths each year among other health implica-\n4If the actual percentage isx%, our value will be approximately scaled by x\n10 [22].\n5\n\n[Image page=5 idx=1 name=I1.png] Size: 2970x1599, Data: 809232 bytes\n\ntions, resulting in a total annual public health burden of$220-300 million throughout the U.S. This includes\n$190-260 million in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and\nWashington D.C. We show the county-level health cost and the top-10 counties in Figure 2, while deferring\nthe details of calculations to Appendix A.1. If the diesel generators in Northern Virginia emit air pollutants\nat the maximum permitted level, the emission of NOx could even exceed half of the annual total emissions\nby all sources in the region [42], resulting in a total public health cost of$2.2-3.0 billion per year.\n3.2 Scope 2: Power Plants\nJust as data centers are accountable for scope-2 carbon emissions, they also contribute to scope-2 air pollution\nthrough their electricity usage.\nAlong with transportation and manufacturing, the combustion of fossil fuels for electricity production is\na leading anthropogenic source of criteria air pollutants, releasing large amounts of PM2.5, SO2, NOx, VOCs,\nand others [30].5 More alarmingly, the growing energy demands of AI data centers are already delaying\nthe decommissioning of coal-fired power plants and driving the expansion of fossil-fuel-based plants in the\nU.S. and globally [6, 65, 66]. For example, in addition to keeping 2,099 MW coal generation capacity until\n2039 (more than 80% of the 2024 level), Virginia Electric and Power Company plans to install 5,934 MW\ngas-fired plants to meet the growing energy demand driven by AI data centers [66].\n2023 2028\nYear\n0\n40\n80\n120\n160\n200\n240\n280\n320\n360Health Cost (Billion $)\nElectricity\nOn-road\nFigure 3:Public health costs of electricity generation and\non-road emissions in the contiguous U.S. in 2023 and\n2028 [39]. The error bars represent high and low esti-\nmates returned by COBRA using two different exposure-\nresponse functions.\nBased on the emission data projected by the U.S.\nEPA’s COBRA modeling tool [39], we show in Fig. 3\nthat the electric power sector’s total public health cost\nin the contiguous U.S. is on track to rise, rivaling that\nof on-road vehicle emissions by all the registered vehi-\ncles (including tailpipe exhausts and brakes) in 2028.\nLooking forward, the U.S. Energy Information Ad-\nministration (EIA) projects that coal consumption by\nthe electricity sector in 2050 will still be approximately\n30% of the 2024 level if power plants continue operat-\ning under rules existing prior to April 2024 [67]. At\nthe global scale, the reliance on coal and other fossil\nfuels for electricity production has seen little change\nover the past four decades, highlighting the enduring\nchallenges to fully adopt clean energy for powering\ndata centers [68]. As a result, data centers’ scope-2\nair pollution is expected to remain at a high level for\na substantially long time into the future.\nAlthough technology companies have started implementing various initiatives—such as purchasing re-\nnewable energy credits and nuclear power from small modular reactors [5,10,69]—to lower their (market-\nbased) carbon emissions, the vast majority of U.S. data centers remain physically and directly powered by\nlocal power grids with a substantial portion of fossil fuel-based energy sources [10]. While the increasingly\nstringent transmission line constraint is also driving the co-location of data centers with power plants to\nspeed up the construction process, the onsite plants are often gas-fired [70,71], raising health concerns [31].\nWe also note that the practice of using various credits to offset scope-2 carbon emissions [10] may not be\neffective for mitigating the scope-2 public health impact. The reason is that the public health impact of using\ngrid electricity is highly location-dependent, e.g., the impact in a populated region may not be mitigated by\nrenewable energy generated elsewhere.\n3.3 Scope 3: Supply Chain\nThe surging demand for AI data centers necessitates large quantities of computational hardware, including\ngraphics processing units (GPUs), thus intensifying the supply chain requirements [72]. However, semicon-\nductor manufacturing generates various criteria air pollutants, wastewater, toxic materials, and hazardous\n5Wet cooling towers, including those used by data centers [9,10] and carbon-free nuclear power plants, rely on water evaporation\nfor heat rejection and produce PM2.5 due to spray drift droplets [63, 64]. Nonetheless, because of limited data available, we exclude\nthe cooling tower PM2.5 emission from our analysis unless other specified.\n6\n\nair emissions [18]. Moreover, the energy-intensive nature of semiconductor production further contributes\nto pollutants from power plants. Combined with other pollution sources such as transportation and elec-\ntronic waste recycling [73], the supply chain activities form a large portion of data centers’ scope-3 impact\non public health.\nAlthough semiconductor manufacturing facilities are subject to air quality regulations [74], they still\npose significant risks, affecting populations across large regions. Importantly, the global demand for AI\nchips in 2030 is projected to be tens of times of the overall production capacity of this single facility [75],\nfurther magnifying the overall scope-3 public health impact of data centers. It is also worth noting that\nadditional pollutants, including hazardous air pollutants like hydrogen fluoride, may further elevate public\nhealth costs but are not included in this paper.\nHowever, public data on scope-3 criteria air pollutant emissions from semiconductor manufacturers is\nlimited. Thus, we focus on scope-1 and scope-2 emissions, excluding scope-3 impacts from the main analy-\nsis. A detailed assessment of the health impacts associated with a specific U.S. semiconductor manufacturing\nfacility is provided in Appendix A.3.\n4 Quantifying Task-Specific Public Health Impact\nTo quantify the public health impact of a specific computing task, we present a principled end-to-end\nmethodology illustrated in Fig. 1. Specifically, the process includes:(1)Quantifying the task’s criteria air\npollutants at the emission source;(2)Modeling the dispersed air pollutants at different receptors (i.e., des-\ntination regions);(3)Calculating the public health impact and assigning a corresponding monetary value\nat each receptor.\nFor a computing task under consideration (e.g., AI model training), we considerMtypes of criteria air\npollutants,Nreceptor regions of interest (e.g., all the U.S. counties),Htypes of public health impacts (e.g.,\nmortality, asthma symptoms, school loss days, etc.). We usep s = (p s\n1,· · ·, p s\nM)andp r\ni = (p r\ni,1,· · ·, p r\ni,M)\ndenote the quantities forMtypes of air pollutants attributed to the task at the emission source and at the\nreceptori, respectively, fori= 1,· · ·, N. Additionally, we useh i = (hi,1,· · ·, h i,H)andc i = (ci,1,· · ·, c i,H)\nto denote the incidences and economic costs associated withHtypes of health impacts at receptori, respec-\ntively, fori= 1,· · ·, N. With a slight abuse of notations, we reuse these symbols when modeling AI’s public\nhealth impacts across the three different scopes.\n4.1 Criteria Air Pollutants at the Source\nWe first model a computing task’s criteria air pollutants at the source across the three different scopes in\nSection 3.\n4.1.1 Scope 1.\nOnsite diesel generators are sized based on the data center power capacity, routinely tested to ensure a high\navailability of the entire data center, and used for demand response. Thus, the overall scope-1 air pollutants\nshould be attributed to each computing task based on its power allocation and duration. Suppose that the\noverall scope-1 emission by an AI data center under consideration is¯ps = (¯ps\n1,· · ·,¯p s\nM), forMtypes of air\npollutants, over a timespan ofT(e.g., one year). Considering a task that is allocated a fraction ofx∈(0,1]\nof the overall data center power capacity and lasts for a duration ofT, we express the scope-1 air pollutants\nattributed to the task as\nps = x·T\nT ·¯ps,(1)\nwhich attributes the overall emission¯ps to the task in proportion to its allocated power and duration.\n4.1.2 Scope 2.\nA computing task’s scope-2 air pollutants come from its usage of electricity generated from fossil fuels. Sup-\npose that the power grid serving the data center has an emission rate ofγ= (γ 1,· · ·, γ M)forMtypes of\nair pollutants to produce each unit of electricity. In practice, the power grid consists of multiple intercon-\nnected power plants to supply electricity to many customers over a wide area (e.g., a balancing area [76]).\nThus, similar to carbon footprint accounting [77], the air pollutant emission rateγcan be calculated based\non either the weighted average emission rate of all the power plants (i.e.,γ=\nP\nk γk·bkP\nk ·bk\nwhereγ k andb k are\n7\n\nthe emission rate and electricity generation of the power plantk) or the emission rate of the marginal power\nplant (i.e., the power plant dispatched in response to the next electricity demand increment), which are re-\nferred to as average emission rate or marginal emission rate, respectively. The average emission represents\na proportional share of the overall air pollutant emission by an electricity consumer, while the marginal\nemission is useful for quantifying the additionality of air pollutants due to a consumer’s electricity usage.\nSuppose that the electricity consumption by the computing task ise, including the data center overhead\ncaptured by the power usage effectiveness. Then, we write the scope-2 air pollutants as\nps =e·γ,(2)\nwhich is either based on either average or marginal accounting.\nTo evaluate the public health impacts of U.S. data centers, we consider the average attribution method\nunless otherwise noted, which is also the standard methodology of carbon emission accounting used by\ntechnology companies in their sustainability reports [10,37,78].\nWe can also refine the calculation of scope-2 air pollutants in (2) by considering the summation of air\npollutants over multiple time slots over the task’s duration.\nLocation-based emission.There are two types of scope-2 carbon emission accounting associated with\nelectricity consumption: location-based and market-based [10]. Specifically, location-based carbon emis-\nsions refer to the physical carbon emissions attributed to an electricity consumer connected to the power\ngrid, while market-based carbon emissions are net emissions after applying reductions due to contractual\narrangements and other credits (e.g., renewable energy credits). As noted by a recent study on carbon ac-\ncounting [79], location-based accounting is consideredessential, whereas market-based accounting isvalu-\nable. Moreover, market-based accounting relies on market instruments whose detailed information is often\nnot publicly disclosed. Thus, in this paper, we follow the literature [8] and focus on location-based account-\ning for scope-2 criteria air pollutants without considering market-based pollution reduction mechanisms.\nWe also note that market-based emission reduction is likely less effective to mitigate the public health\nimpact. The reason is that, unlike carbon emissions that have a similar effect on climate change regardless of\nthe emission locations, the public health impact of criteria air pollutants heavily depends on the location of\nthe emission source. For example, the public health impact of using pollutant-intensive electricity generated\nfrom a populated region may not be effectively mitigated by the clean energy credits generated elsewhere.\n4.1.3 Scope 3.\nWhile our empirical analysis focuses on scope-1 and scope-2 health impacts, we present the scope-3 pol-\nlutant attribution method to provide a more complete view. Specifically, following the attribution method\nfor scope-3 carbon emission and water consumption [9,13], we attribute the computing hardware’s air pol-\nlutants during the manufacturing process to a specific task based on the task duration. Specifically, let the\nhardware’s expected lifespan be T 0 and the task lasts a duration ofT. Considering that theMtypes of\nair pollutants for manufacturing the hardware are¯ps\n0 = (¯ps\n0,1,· · ·,¯p s\n0,M)and excluding other miscellaneous\npollutants (e.g., transportation), we obtain the task’s scope-3 air pollutants as\nps = T\nT 0\n·¯ps\n0.(3)\nAs a server cluster includes multiple hardware components (e.g., GPU and CPU) manufactured in different\nlocations, we apply (3) to estimate the scope-3 air pollutants for each component manufactured in a different\nlocation.\n4.2 Air Quality Dispersion Modeling\nOnce emitted from their sources, criteria air pollutants can travel long distances, impacting multiple states\nalong their paths. Unlike carbon emissions that have a similar effect on climate change regardless of the\nemission source locations, the public health impact of criteria air pollutants heavily depends on the location\nof the emission source. Generally, the closer a receptor is to the source, the greater the air quality impact.\nFurthermore, the dispersion of air pollutants is influenced by meteorological conditions, such as wind speed\nand direction.\nIn practice, dispersion modeling tools are used to track the movement of air pollutants. These tools em-\nploy complex mathematical equations to simulate the atmospheric processes governing the dispersion. By\n8\n\nincorporating emission data and meteorological inputs, dispersion modeling can predict pollutant concen-\ntrations at selected receptor locations [80]. We consider a general dispersion modeling tool(pr\n1,· · ·, p r\nN) =\nDθ(ps), which yields the amount ofMtypes of air pollutantsp r\ni = (p r\ni,1,· · ·, p r\ni,M)at the receptor region\ni= 1,· · ·, N. The parameterθcaptures the geographical conditions, emission source characteristics (e.g.,\nheight), and meteorological data [81]. We apply the dispersion model to each scope of air pollutants (Sec-\ntion 4.1) to estimate the corresponding pollutant concentrations at receptor regions.\nSeveral dispersion modeling tools are available, including AERMOD, PCAPS and InMAP with a reduced\ncomplexity [22,80,82,83]. For example, PCAPS (Pattern Constructed Air Pollution Surfaces), an advanced\nreduced-complexity model that provides representations of both primarily emitted PM2.5 and secondarily\nformed PM2.5 and ozone, is used in COBRA as a quick assessment of otherwise lengthy iterations and simu-\nlations of various pollution scenarios in terms of the annual average PM2.5 and seasonal average maximum\ndaily average 8-hour ozone [22, 83]. Even compared with state-of-the-science photochemical grid models,\nPCAPS provides similar prediction accuracies and can realistically capture the change in air pollution due to\nchanging emissions [83]. More specifically, for electric power sectors and on-road/highway vehicle sectors\n(the two sectors we consider in Section 5), the prediction results of PCAPS compare very well with photo-\nchemical model predictions, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.94, respectively [22,83].\n4.3 Converting Health Outcomes to Economic Costs\nBy assessing pollutant levelsp r\ni = (p r\ni,1,· · ·, p r\ni,M)and population size at each receptor regioni, we can\nestimate the incidences of health outcomesh i = (h i,1,· · ·, h i,H)and the corresponding public health cost\nci = (c i,1,· · ·, c i,H). The relations betweenp r\ni andh i and betweenh i andc i is captured by an exposure-\nresponse function and can be established based on epidemiology research [22]. For example, the premature\nmortality rate can be modeled as a log-linear function in terms of the PM2.5 level [84].\nFurther, by summing up the economic costs, we obtain quantitative estimates of the public health burden\nat both regional and national levels. It is important to note that the public health cost is not necessarily an\nout-of-pocket expense incurred by each individual, but rather reflects the estimated economic burden on a\npopulation to mitigate the adverse effects of pollutants within a specific region. Therefore, it is a quantitative\nscalar measure of the public health impact resulting from a particular pollutant-producing activity.\n4.4 End-to-End Modeling\nFollowing the end-to-end process shown in Fig. 1, we now briefly describe our modeling methodology to\nstudy the public health impact of U.S. data centers and AI training. The details are available in Appendix A.\nTo quantify data centers’ scope-1 and scope-2 air pollutant emissions, we use air quality permit data for\nonsite generators [60] and electricity consumption data, including both historical records and 2028 projec-\ntions, from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report [4].\nTo model the air pollutant dispersion and quantify health impacts, we use the latest COBRA (Desktop\nv5.1, as of October 2024) provided by the U.S. EPA [39]. COBRA integrates reduced-complexity air dis-\npersion modeling (including both primarily emitted PM 2.5 and secondly formed PM 2.5 and ozone [83])\nwith various concentration-response functions [22], offering a quantitative screening analysis particularly\nsuitable for large-scale health impacts. The same or similar reduced-complexity modeling tools have been\ncommonly used in the literature to examine the health impacts of various industries over a large area [82,85],\nincluding electric vehicles [86], bitcoin mining [87], and inter-region electricity imports [88], among others.\nWhile each health impact model used by COBRA considers 95% confidence intervals, the high-end and low-\nend estimates provided by COBRA are based on different models instead of the 95% confidence interval of\na single model [22].\n5 Results\nWe now present our estimates of the public health impacts caused by the U.S. data centers in aggregate and\nby training a large generative AI model at specific locations. We focus on the contiguous U.S., which hosts\nnearly half of the world’s data centers [38], and simply refer to it as the U.S. For consistency with COBRA,\ncities considered county-equivalents for census purposes are also referred to as “counties” in our paper. All\nour monetary values are for one year (or one computing task if applicable) and in 2023 U.S. dollars as used\nby COBRA.\n9\n\nOur results demonstrate that in 2028, the total scope-1 and scope-2 pollutants of U.S. data centers alone\ncould cause, among others, approximately 600,000 asthma symptom cases and 1,300 premature deaths,\nexceeding 1/3 of asthma deaths in the U.S. each year [40]. The overall public health costs could reach more\nthan$20 billion, rival or even top those of on-road emissions of the largest U.S. states such as California\nwith∼35 million registered vehicles [41]. Importantly, the health costs are unevenly distributed across\ncounties and communities, particularly affecting low-income counties that could experience approximately\n200x per-household health costs than others. Moreover, depending on the locations, training an AI model of\nthe Llama-3.1 scale can produce an amount of air pollutants equivalent to driving a passenger car for more\nthan 10,000 LA-NYC round trips, resulting in a health cost that even exceeds 120% of the training electricity\ncost.\n5.1 Public Health Impact of U.S. Data Centers\nWe now present our public health impact analysis for U.S. data centers in aggregate, beginning with the\nhistorical analysis from 2019 to 2023 and highlighting the uneven distribution of health impacts, followed\nby a 2028 projection. The overall trend is shown in Fig. 4, which demonstrates a significant increase in the\npublic health impact of U.S. data centers from 2023 to 2028. Specifically, the surging demand for AI data\ncenters in the U.S. has outweighed the power plant emission efficiency improvement, potentially tripling\nthe public health cost from 2023 to 2028.\nWe present the details in Table 1 and see that scope-2 health cost dominates the scope-1 cost. 6 This\nsuggests that while using alternative fuels for onsite generators can help improve local air quality around\ndata centers, greater health benefits can be achieved by powering data centers with pollutant-free electricity\nsources.\nMobile sources, including vehicles, marine engines, and generators, collectively account for more than\nhalf of the air pollutants in the U.S., with vehicles being a primary contributor [89,90]. Thus, to contextualize\nthe public health costs of data centers, we compare them to on-road emissions in the three largest U.S. states\n(California, Texas, and Florida). In particular, California, which has about 35 million registered vehicles,\nexhibits the highest public health cost from on-road emissions among all U.S. states [39,41]. In the COBRA\nmodel, on-road emissions are categorized under the “Highway Vehicles” sector and include both tailpipe\nexhaust and tire and brake wear. The details of calculating on-road emissions and the corresponding health\ncosts are provided in Appendix A.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, in 2023, the total public health cost of U.S. data centers is 42% of that from California’s\non-road emissions. Due to the tightening air pollutant regulations [91], the health costs of on-road emissions\nhave generally decreased from 2019 to 2028. However, with rapid growth, the public health impact of U.S.\ndata centers is projected to rival or even surpass that of California’s on-road emissions by 2028, underscoring\nthe need for greater attention to the growing public health impacts of the data center industry.\n5.1.1 Historical analysis: 2019-2023.\nTable 1 shows the public health cost of U.S. data centers from 2019 to 2023 as a reference. Even at the\nbeginning of the generative AI boom, the U.S. data centers have already resulted in a total public health cost\nof about$6.7 billion, or$47.5 per household, in 2023. This is equivalent to approximately 44% of the data\ncenters’ total electricity cost.\nNext, we show in Fig. 5 the county-level total public health cost of U.S. data centers from 2019 to 2023,\nwhich exhibits significant spatial variability. In particular, populated counties located downwind of power\nplants supplying electricity to data centers tend to experience higher health costs, reflecting the transport of\nair pollutants across regions. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) in Fig. 5b highlights that while\nmany counties incur relatively low health costs, a small fraction of counties bear substantially higher impacts.\nTable 5c further identifies the top-10 counties with the highest total health costs, illustrating how local pop-\nulation density and proximity to power generation infrastructure combine to amplify public health risks in\nspecific communities.\n6We use the “mid (low, high)” format to represent the midrange, low and high estimates offered by COBRA. When presenting a\nsingle value or a ratio (e.g., health-to-electricity cost ratio), we use the midrange by default.\n10\n\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2028\nYear\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30Health Cost (Billion $)\nOn-road CA\nOn-road FL\nOn-road TX\nData Center (Low)\nData Center (High)\nFigure 4:The public health costs of U.S. data centers and top-3 state on-road emissions from 2019 to 2023 and the 2028\nprojection based on the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab’s report [4].

IR\nrepresents “County-to-Nation Per-Household Median Income Ratio.”\ndifferent communities in terms of the public health cost suggests that we need to carefully examine the local\nand regional health impacts of data centers and improve public health equity to enable truly responsible\ncomputing.\nFurthermore, many of the hardest-hit communities neither host large data centers nor directly benefit\neconomically from AI data centers, such as through tax revenues. For example, several counties in West\nVirginia are among the most affected, because many coal-fired power plants in West Virginia are supplying\nelectricity to data centers in the neighboring state of Virginia [4, 5]. By contrast, despite hosting a large\nnumber of data centers and incurring high total health costs due to its large population, California’s clean\npower grid results in some of the lowest per-household health impacts in the country.\n5.1.3 Projection for 2028.\nAccording to a recent Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) report [4], the U.S. data center elec-\ntricity consumption is expected to increase from 4.4% of the total national electricity use in 2023 to 6.7–12.0%\nin 2028, depending on the growth trajectory of AI adoption. At the same time, the projected rise in peak\npower demand is accompanied by massive installations of onsite backup diesel generators to ensure relia-\nbility during grid contingencies [60].\nThis substantial growth in electricity demand and onsite generation is expected to offset, and in fact\noutweigh, the gradual pollution emission intensity reductions anticipated from the power sector. As a result,\nthe total public health costs attributable to data center operations are projected to potentially triple from 2023\nto 2028. Quantitatively, based on the low- and high-growth scenarios considered in [4], the total public\nhealth impact of U.S. data centers is estimated to reach$11.7 billion and$20.9 billion in 2028, respectively.\nUnder the high-growth scenario, the resulting health burden could rival or exceed that of on-road emissions\nin the largest U.S. state.

As the scope-2 impact is dominant and the power allocated to train Llama-3.1 is unknown to\ndetermine scope-1 impacts, we focus on scope-2 health costs associated with the electricity consumption.\nWhile we use Meta’s Llama-3.1 training electricity consumption and U.S. data center locations as an example,\nour results should be interpreted as the estimated public health impact of training a general LLM with a\ncomparable scale of Llama-3.1.\nWe show the results in Table 2. It can be seen that the total health cost can even exceed 120% of the\nelectricity cost and vary widely depending on the training data center locations. For example, the total\nhealth cost is only$0.23 million in Oregon, whereas the cost will increase dramatically to$2.5 million in Iowa\ndue to various factors, such as the wind direction and the pollutant emission rate for electricity generation\n[76]. Additionally, depending on the locations, training an AI model of the Llama-3.1 scale can produce an\namount of air pollutants equivalent to more than 10,000 LA-NYC round trips by car.\nThe results highlight that the public health impact of AI model training is highly location-dependent.\nCombined with the spatial flexibility of model training, they suggest that AI model developers should take\ninto account potential health impacts when choosing data center locations for training.\n5.3 Location-Dependent Public Health Impacts of Two Technology Companies\nWe further highlight locational dependency of public health impacts by considering two major technology\ncompanies’ U.S. data center locations in 2023, excluding their leased colocation data centers whose locations\nare proprietary. We name these two companies A and B, respectively. These two companies do not have\nsame data center locations. While company B discloses its per-location electricity usage [37], company A\ndoes not. Thus, we uniformly distribute company B’s North America electricity consumption over its U.S.\ndata center locations based on its latest sustainability report [10]. We consider location-based emission\naccounting without taking into account renewable energy credits these two companies apply to offset their\ngrid electricity consumption (see “Location-based emission” in Section 4.1.2).\nWe see from Fig. 7 that the two companies have significant differences in terms of the per-household\nhealth cost distribution and most-affected counties. This is primarily due to the two companies’ different\ndata center locations, and highlights the locational dependency of public health impacts. That is, unlike\ncarbon emissions that have a similar effect regardless of the emission source locations, the public health\nimpact of criteria air pollutants heavily depends on the location of the emission source. Thus, technology\ncompanies should account for public health impacts when deciding where they build data centers, where\nthey get electricity for their data centers, and where they install onsite renewables in order to best mitigate\nthe adverse health effects.\n13\n\n[Image page=13 idx=1 name=I1.png] Size: 2970x1599, Data: 1319189 bytes\n\n[Image page=13 idx=2 name=I1.png] Size: 2970x1599, Data: 1278105 bytes\n\n6 Health-Informed Computing: Addressing Data Centers’ Public Health\nImpact\nIn this section, we present Health-Informed Computing, a framework that explicitly incorporates public\nhealth impacts as a key optimization objective and strategically manages data center workloads to minimize\nadverse health outcomes while supporting broader sustainability goals.\nTo mitigate the public health impact of computing, one straightforward approach is to focus solely on\nreducing the energy consumption (e.g., reducing AI model sizes [93,94]). While reducing energy consump-\ntion is beneficial, overlooking the downstream public health impact ofwhereandwhenenergy is produced\ndoes not necessarily lead to minimized health burdens. For example, Table 2 demonstrates a 10x difference\nin health costs for training the same AI model across different locations. This highlights that health-informed\nand energy-aware computing, when combined, offer complementary benefits, leading to better public health\noutcomes.\n6.1 Opportunities for Health-Informed Computing\nData centers, including those operated by major technology companies [10,37], predominantly rely on grid\nelectricity due to the practical challenges of installing on-site low-pollutant and low-carbon energy sources\nat scale. However, the spatial-temporal variations of scope-2 health costs (Fig. 8) open up new opportunities\nto reduce the public health impact by exploiting the high scheduling flexibilities of computing workloads\n(e.g., AI training). For example, as further supported by EPRI’s recent initiative on maximizing data center\nflexibility for demand response [11], AI training can be scheduled in more than one data center, while\nmultiple AI models with different sizes are often available to serve AI inference requests, offering flexible\nresource-performance tradeoffs.\nTo date, the existing data centers have mostly exploited such scheduling flexibilities for reducing elec-\ntricity costs [95], carbon emissions [15], water consumption [96], and/or environmental inequity [97].\nNonetheless, the public health impact of AI significantly differs from these environmental costs or metrics.\nConcretely, despite sharing some common sources (e.g., fossil fuels) with carbon emissions, the public\nhealth impact resulting from the dispersion of criteria air pollutants is highly dependent on the emission\nsource location and only exhibits a weak correlation with carbon emissions. For example, the same quantity\nof carbon emissions generally results in the same climate change impacts regardless of the emission source;\nin contrast, criteria air pollutants have substantially greater public health impacts if emitted in densely pop-\nulated regions compared to sparsely populated or unpopulated regions, emphasizing the importance of\nconsidering spatial variability.\nTo further confirm this point and highlight the potential of health-informed data center load shifting, we\nanalyze the scope-2 marginal carbon intensity and public health cost for each unit of electricity generation\nacross all the 114 U.S. regions between October 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024, provided by WattTime [77].7\nThe time granularity for data collection is 5 minutes.\nHere, we focus on marginal health impacts and carbon emissions for two main reasons: first, WattTime\nprovides only real-time marginal health impact estimates [98]; and second, marginal signals are generally\nconsidered more useful for guiding energy load adjustments [99], which also explain why the EPA reports\nmarginal health benefits per kWh (i.e., marginal health price) to inform energy demand changes [100].\nWe show in Fig. 8a the region-wise normalized interquartile ranges (IQR divided by the yearly average)\nfor both public health costs and carbon emissions. The normalized IQR measures the spread of the time-\nvarying health and carbon signals. Specifically, in 110 out of the 114 U.S. regions (96%), the normalized IQR\nof health cost is higher than that of the carbon intensity for each unit of electricity consumption. Moreover,\nthe normalized IQR for carbon emissions is less than 0.2 in most of the regions. This implies that health\ncosts exhibit a greater temporal variation than carbon emissions in 110 out of the 114 U.S. regions. Likewise,\nin Fig. 8b, the greater temporal variation of health costs is also supported by its greater normalized standard\ndeviation (STD divided by the yearly average) in 90 out of the 114 U.S. regions (79%). Next, we show in\nFig. 8c the weak spatial correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.292) between the yearly average health\ncost and carbon intensity across the 114 regions. Furthermore, the normalized IQR of the health cost spatial\n7The health cost signal provided by [77] only considers mortality from PM2.5, while COBRA includes a variety of health outcomes\nincluding asthma, lung cancer, and mortality from ozone, among others [22].\n14\n\n0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5\nCarbon IQR\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\n1.2\n1.5Health Cost IQR\n(a)Normalized IQR (110)\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\nCarbon STD\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8Health Cost STD (b)Normalized STD (90)\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\nCarbon (kg/MWh)\n0\n30\n60\n90\n120Health Cost ($/MWh) (c)Average\nFigure 8:Analysis of marginal scope-2 carbon emission rates and public health costs over 114 U.S. regions between\nOctober 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024 [77].

In other words, the health\ncost could have a greater spatial spread than the carbon emission.\nIn addition to analysis for all U.S. regions, we turn to specific regions where a large technology company\nbuilds its U.S. data centers. We present the results Table 3, further confirming that carbon intensities and\nhealth impacts are not always aligned and that health impacts vary more significantly than carbon intensities\nin almost all the locations.\nWe further analyze the Pearson correlation coefficients between hourly marginal health prices and car-\nbon emission rates throughout 2023 for the U.S. regions that have complete health and carbon data provided\nby WattTime [77]. The CDF of the correlation coefficients is shown in Figure 9a. We see that nearly 70%\nof the regions have a weak or moderate correlation, with a carbon-health correlation coefficient of less than\n0.60. This implies that despite having fossil fuels as the common source, health costs and carbon emissions\nare different and can exhibit trade-offs. Moreover, due to their additional dependence on population distri-\nbution and meteorological conditions, health prices demonstrate more pronounced temporal fluctuations\nthan carbon emissions.\n15\n\nThese findings highlight that leveraging spatiotemporal variations in a health-aware manner can sub-\nstantially reduce the public health costs of data center operations. Moreover, the observed distinctions be-\ntween health impacts and carbon emissions suggest the need to optimize data center decisions by explicitly\naccounting for and exploiting the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of health impacts.\n6.2 Benefits of Health-Informed Computing\nTo improve system performance and reliability, technology companies typically operate data centers over\na variety of geographically distributed regions anddynamicallydistribute computing workloads through a\nprocess known as geographical load balancing (GLB). Here, we leverage the unique spatial load flexibility\nof geographically distributed data centers to demonstrate the benefits of health-informed computing as a\nproof of concept.\nHealth-Informed GLB.Specifically, we study health-informed GLB (HI-GLB) to address the public health\nburden of data center operation. We consider a discrete-time model of durationTand measure the work-\nloads in terms of their energy demand. For the sake of examining the impact of spatial flexibility, we assume\nthat the energy loads (i.e., workloads) can be flexibly distributed across a set ofNdata centers denoted as\nN={1,2, . . . , N}. In each timet∈ {1,2, . . . , T}, the total energy demand isM t, andw i,t represents the load\nassigned to data centeri. We usel i to represent the default load capacity of data centeri, and introduce a\nslackness parameterλ≥1to represent the ability of each data center to accept loads in excess of its default\ncapacity. Thus, the greater the value ofλ, the more spatial flexibility the operator has. In each timet, we\nusep e\ni,t andp h\ni,t to denote the electricity price and health price at data centeri, respectively.\nThe health priceph\ni,t depends on the emission source of criteria air pollutants (e.g., power plants’ emission\nrates and their locations), air pollutant dispersion, and estimates of adverse health outcomes and resulting\ncosts attributed to the increased air pollutant concentration in each region [22]. Thus, the health price\nquantifies the ultimate health burden imposed on affected populations and is measured in terms of economic\ncosts for each unit of electricity consumption. It varies over time due to fluctuations in the grid’s generation\nmix and changing meteorological conditions. Third-party organizations such as WattTime [98] provide real-\ntime estimates of the marginal health price of electricity across 114 power balancing regions in the U.S., while\nthe EPA [100] reports annualized average health prices for electricity in 14 broader regions nationwide.\nOur goal is to minimize the sum of electricity costsPT\nt=1\nPN\ni=1 pe\ni,t ·w i,t and health costsPT\nt=1\nPN\ni=1 ph\ni,t ·\nwi,t across all regions. Thus,HI-GLBis formulated as follows:\nmin\nw\nTX\nt=1\nNX\ni=1\npe\ni,t ·w i,t +\nTX\nt=1\nNX\ni=1\nph\ni,t ·w i,t (4a)\ns.t.\nNX\ni=1\nwi,t =M t,∀t∈ T(4b)\n0≤w i,t ≤λ·l i,∀i∈ N,∀t∈ T(4c)\nwhere the constraint (4b) means that all loads must be dispatched to a data center (with no loads dropped)\nand the constraint (4c) encodes the maximum workload capacity of each data center.\nOur formulation can be easily extended to incorporate additional considerations such as load dispatching\ndistance constraints and other metrics such as carbon emissions. Additionally, it can also include long-term,\nper-region health impact constraints, rather than focusing solely on national-level total health costs. For\nthe sake of clarity, we set these extensions aside to focus on the novel metric of health cost for data center\nresource management.\nWe use Meta’s electricity consumption for each U.S. data center location in 2023 [37] as the baseline. Our\nstudy is intended to illustrate the potential benefits of health-informed GLB and should not be interpreted\nas representing Meta’s actual health impacts. For comparison, we consider carbon-aware GLB which min-\nimizes the cost objective PT\nt=1\nPN\ni=1 pe\ni,t ·w i,t + PT\nt=1\nPN\ni=1 pc ·r c\ni,t ·w i,t, wherer c\ni,t is the carbon emission\nrate andp c is the carbon price to encourage carbon reduction. We vary the carbon pricep c from$5/ton to\n$200/ton, which is consistent with the range adopted by the U.S. federal government over several previous\nadministrations [101]. Additionally, as two special cases, we include$0/ton and$∞/ton, which represent\nthe respective cases of purely optimizing electricity costs and purely minimizing carbon emissions.

To quantify the carbon emissions of each location, we consider the marginal\ncarbon emissions rate provided by WattTime [77]. We specifically use marginal carbon emissions for a fair\ncomparison with the marginal health price, and since this metric often better reflects the actual impact on\nsystem-wide carbon emissions resulting from demand-side load shifting [99]. More details can be found in\nAppendix B.1.\nHealth-Informed vs. Carbon-Aware GLB.We show results comparing GLB with health and carbon\ncosts in Table 4. The results highlight that optimizing solely for environmental metrics like carbon does\nnot effectively mitigate health impacts. Concretely, as the carbon price varies, the health cost ranges be-\ntween$380 million and$420 million, whereas the baseline health cost is approximately$393 million. When\npc = $200/ton, the health cost decreases by 2.52% relative to the baseline. However, for all other carbon\nprices, the health cost increases by using carbon-aware GLB. Among these, the algorithm that focuses solely\non minimizing carbon (p c =∞) leads to a 2.80% increase in health cost compared to the baseline. This\nstands in sharp contrast toHI-GLB, which achieves a substantial∼26% reduction in health cost compared to\nthe baseline, demonstrating that environmental metrics such as carbon are insufficient for mitigating health\nimpacts unless public health considerations are explicitly integrated into the optimization process. More-\nover, compared to the pure health-informed GLB that sets a zero electricity price (p e = 0),HI-GLBonly\nslightly increases the health cost from$290 million to$292 million, further demonstrating that considering\nthe health price can effectively drive healthier GLB decisions while maintaining low cost.\nAt the same time, the pure carbon-aware GLB algorithm achieves a maximum reduction in carbon re-\nduction of 7.23% while increasing the health burden and electricity cost relative to the baseline. In contrast,\nHI-GLBachieves 26% health cost reduction, 3% electricity cost saving, and more than 1% carbon reduction.\nThis highlights the necessity of adopting health-informed algorithms for health burden reduction while\noffering co-benefits of cost saving and carbon reduction.\nWe also vary the capacity slacknessλto change the spatial flexibility and obtain similar insights. The\nfull details are available in Appendix B.2.\n17\n\nSpatial correlation analysis.To further explain the results, we analyze the correlation between health\ncosts and carbon emissions across the 13 regions where Meta operates its U.S. data centers. Figure 9b\npresents a scatter plot illustrating the correlation between the annual average carbon emission rate and\nhealth price across various regions. The Pearson correlation coefficient between different locations’ health\nprices and carbon emissions is approximately -0.35, indicating a negative relationship. This suggests a po-\ntential conflict between efforts to optimize carbon emissions and those aimed at improving health outcomes\nvia GLB. Furthermore, as highlighted by the spatial patterns in Figure 9b, the health prices exhibit a signif-\nicantly higher degree of spatial variability compared to carbon emissions across regions. This discrepancy\nfurther reinforces the point that focusing solely on optimizing environmental factors, such as carbon emis-\nsions, may not effectively reduce health costs, underscoring the importance of integrating health-informed\noptimization strategies to achieve more comprehensive benefits.\n7 Our Recommendations\nWe provide additional recommendations to address the growing public health impact of data centers.\nRecommendation 1: Standardization of Reporting Protocols\nDespite their immediate and tangible impacts on public health, criteria air pollutants have been entirely\noverlooked in AI model cards and sustainability reports published by technology companies [10, 36, 37].\nThe absence of such critical information adds substantial challenges to accurately identifying specific AI\ndata centers as a key root cause of public health burdens and could potentially pose hidden risks to public\nhealth. To enhance transparency and lay the foundation for truly responsible AI, we recommend stan-\ndardization of reporting protocols for criteria air pollutants and the public health impacts across different\nregions. Concretely, criteria air pollutants can be categorized into three different scopes (Section 3), and\nreported following the greenhouse gas protocol widely adopted by technology companies [10,37,78].\nJust as addressing scope-2 and scope-3 carbon emissions is important for mitigating climate change, it\nis equally crucial to address scope-2 and scope-3 criteria air pollutants to promote public health through-\nout the power generation and hardware manufacturing processes in support of AI. For instance, power\nplants are dispatched based on real-time energy demand to ensure grid stability. As a result, only focusing\non regulating scope-2 air pollutants at the power plant level fails to address the root cause — electricity\nconsumption — and overlooks the potential of demand-side solutions. In contrast, recognizing scope-2 air\npollutants and their associated public health impacts enables novel opportunities for health-informed AI,\nwhich, as detailed below, taps into demand-side flexibilities to holistically reduce AI’s adverse public health\nimpacts.\nRecommendation 2: Attention to All\nCounties and communities located near AI data centers or supplying electricity to them often experience\nmost significant health burdens. Nonetheless, these health impacts can extend far beyond the immedi-\nate vicinity, affecting communities hundreds of miles away [24, 25]. For example, the health impact of\nbackup generators in northern Virginia can affect several surrounding states (Fig. 2a) and even reach as\nfar as Florida.\nWhile the health impact on communities where data centers operate is increasingly recognized, there\nhas been very little, if any, attention paid to other impacted communities that bear substantial public health\nburdens. This disconnect leaves those communities to shoulder the public health cost of AI silently without\nreceiving adequate support. To fulfill their commitment to social responsibility, we recommend technology\ncompanies holistically evaluate thecross-statepublic health burden imposed by their operations on all im-\npacted communities, when deciding where they build data centers, where they get electricity for their data\ncenters, and where they install renewables.\nAdditionally, to quantify the health effects on impacted communities with greater accuracy for potential\nregulatory actions, we recommend further interdisciplinary research such as cross-state air quality disper-\nsion, health economics, and health-informed computing.\n18\n\nRecommendation 3: Promoting Public Health Equity\nThe public health impact of AI is highly unevenly distributed across different counties and communities,\ndisproportionately affecting certain (often low-income) communities [31, 103]. For example, as shown in\nTable 6c, all the top-10 most impacted counties in the U.S. have lower median household incomes than the\nnational median value. The ratio of the highest county-level per-household health cost to the lowest cost\nis approximately 200. Therefore, it is imperative to address the substantial health impact disparities across\ncommunities.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we quantify and address the overlooked public health impact of data centers. We introduce\na principled methodology to model these lifecycle pollutant emissions and quantify their associated public\nhealth impacts. Our findings suggest that the total annual public health burden of U.S. data centers could\nexceed$20 billion by 2028, approaching or even surpassing the impacts of on-road vehicle emissions in\nCalifornia. Importantly, these health costs are not evenly distributed: disadvantaged communities bear a\ndisproportionate share, with per-household impacts potentially up to 200 times higher than in less-affected\nareas. This highlights the need for targeted mitigation strategies. To this end, we propose health-informed\ncomputing, a framework that explicitly incorporates public health risk as a key metric when scheduling data\ncenter workloads, enabling more informed and equitable operational decisions.\nMore broadly, we recommend the adoption of standardized reporting protocols for the public health\ncosts of data centers, alongside policies that ensure attention to all impacted communities, thereby support-\ning responsible, sustainable, and inclusive deployment of AI infrastructure.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Susan Wierman for providing comments on an initial draft of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We use the latest COBRA (Desktop\nv5.1, as of October 2024) provided by the U.S. EPA [39] to study the public health impact of U.S. data centers\nin both 2019-2023 and 2028. While COBRA uses a reduced-complexity air quality dispersion model based\non a source-receptor matrix for rapid evaluation, its accuracy has been validated and the same or similar\nmodel has been commonly adopted in the literature for large-area air quality and health impact analysis\n[82, 85, 87, 88]. We consider county-level air pollutant dispersion throughout the contiguous U.S., which\nis the area currently supported by COBRA [39]. Note that cities considered county-equivalents for census\npurposes are also referred to as “counties” in COBRA. Throughout the paper, we use “county” without\nfurther specification.\nAll the monetary values are presented in the 2023 U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. We set the dis-\ncount rate as 2% in COBRA as recommended by the EPA based on the U.S. Office of Management and Budget\nCircular No. A-4 guidance [39]. When presenting a single value or a ratio (e.g., health-to-electricity cost\nratio) if applicable, we use the midrange of the low and high estimates provided by COBRA.\nCOBRA provides data for county-level population, health incidence, valuation, and baseline emissions\nfor 2016, 2023, and 2028 [39]. For the data from 2019 to 2022, we use linear interpolation as recommended\nby the EPA’s COBRA team.\nWe show in Table 5 and Table 6 the total baseline emissions of air pollutants for electricity generation\nand on-road traffic provided by COBRA [39]. By reducing a state’s on-road emissions to zero in COBRA,\nwe obtain the corresponding public health cost in that state.\nTable 5:U.S. electricity generation baseline emissions from 2016 to 2028\nYear Electricity Generation Emission(Metric Ton)\nNOx SO2 PM2.5 VOC\n2016 1100575.41 1369417.44 111604.62 30250.76\n2023 711746.94 717409.25 110878.22 34311.54\n2028 695495.34 733437.11 110279.40 34446.71\nTable 6:U.S. and California on-road baseline emissions from 2016 to 2028\nYear\nU.S. On-road Emission(Metric Ton) California On-road Emission(Metric Ton)\nNOx SO2 PM2.5 VOC NOx SO2 PM2.5 VOC\n2016 3293579.05 25001.53 106828.36 1680342.17 202427.66 1438.07 10197.26 89087.60\n2023 1588423.83 11325.07 65742.16 996965.92 98095.76 1280.27 8144.83 54141.57\n2028 1130369.84 10616.37 53455.43 758508.40 86573.30 1154.27 8276.27 44586.45\nOn-road emissions are categorized as the “Highway Vehicles” sector in COBRA and include both tailpipe\nexhaust and tire and brake wear. Thus, following the EPA and U.S. Department of Transportation classifica-\ntion [22,104], PM2.5 resulting from road dust is not counted as emissions of highway vehicles in our study.\nIf the PM2.5 from paved road dust (categorized as “Miscellaneous→Other Fugitive Dust→Paved Roads”\nin COBRA) is considered, California is still projected to have the highest state-wide public health cost of\non-road vehicles among all the U.S. states.\nElectricity price.When estimating the electricity cost for data centers in 2023 and 2038, we use the state-\nlevel average price for industrial users in [102]. The projected U.S. nominal electricity price for industrial\nusers remains nearly the same from 2023 to 2030 (24.96$/MMBtu in 2023 vs. 23.04$/MMBTu in 2030) in the\nbaseline case per the EIA’s Energy Outlook 2023 [105]. Thus, our estimated health-to-electricity cost ratio\nwill be even higher if we further adjust inflation.\nA.1 Public Health Impact of Backup Generators in Virginia\nVirginia has issued a total of 174 air quality permits for data center backup generators as of December 1,\n2024 [60]. More than half of the data center sites are within Loudoun County. We collect a dataset of the\nair quality permits: permits issued before January 1, 2023, from [62], and permits issued between January\n26\n\n1, 2023 and December 1, 2024, from [60]. The total permitted site-level annual emission limits are approxi-\nmately 13,000 tons of NOx, 1,400 tons of VOCs, 50 tons of SO2, and 600 tons of PM2.5, all in U.S. short tons.\nBy assuming that the actual emissions are 10% of the permitted level, the data centers in Virginia could\nalready cause approximately 14,000 asthma symptom cases and 13-19 deaths each year, among other health\nimplications, resulting in a total annual public health burden of$220-300 million, including$190-260 mil-\nlion incurred in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and\nWashington D.C., as estimated by COBRA under the “Fuel Combustion: Industrial” sector.\nThe scope-1 emission information for data centers in other states is not always publicly available. Thus,\nwhen estimating scope-1 emissions for data centers in another state, we apply the emission rate (tons/MWh)\nderived from Virginia’s data and multiply it by the energy consumption of data centers in that states. Al-\nthough this approach may introduce some estimation errors, the impact is expected to be limited because\nscope-2 health costs are substantially more dominant.\nA.2 Data Centers’ Scope-2 Public Health Impact\nThe locations of emission sources depend on the power plants supplying electricity to data centers. To\nevaluate the public health impacts of U.S. data centers, we focus on average attribution method, which\nis also the standard methodology of carbon emission accounting used by technology companies in their\nsustainability reports [10,37,78].\nWe first calculate the total data center electricity consumptioneDC and the overall electricity consump-\ntion (including non-data center loads)e T otal within each electricity region. The U.S. electricity grid is di-\nvided into 14 regions following the A Voided Emissions and geneRation Tool (A VERT, the latest version v4.3\nas of October 2024) provided by the EPA [76]. We use the state-level data center electricity consumption\ndistribution for 2023 provided by EPRI [5], scale it by the U.S. total data center electricity consumption in\n2019-2023 and for the 2028 projection based on data provided by [4], and then distribute state-level electric-\nity consumption to relevant electricity regions following the state-to-region electricity apportionment used\nby A VERT.\nWe calculate the percentagex% = eDC\neT otal\nof the data center electricity consumption with respect to the\noverall electricity consumption for each electricity region. The relationship between the health impact and\nemission reduction in COBRA is approximately linear. Thus, we apply a reduction byx%to the baseline\nemissions of all the power plants within the respective electricity region in COBRA and estimate the corre-\nsponding county-level health impacts, including health outcomes and costs.\nWhen assessing the health impact of generative AI training, we follow the same approach, except for\nchanging the total data center electricity consumption to the AI model training electricity consumption.\nA.3 Public Health Impact of a Semiconductor Facility\nAlthough semiconductor manufacturing facilities are subject to air quality regulations [74], they still pose\nsignificant risks, affecting populations across large regions. Maricopa County, AZ, has been an EPA-designated\nnon-attainment area for several years due to its failures to meet federal air quality standards [106]. The es-\ntablishment of multiple semiconductor facilities in such areas could further exacerbate air quality issues.\nWe consider a semiconductor manufacturing facility located in Ocotillo, a neighborhood in Chandler,\nArizona [107]. By averaging the rolling 12-month air pollutant emission levels listed in the recent air qual-\nity monitoring report (as of October, 2024) [18], we obtain the annual emissions as follows: 150.4 tons of\nNOx, 82.7 tons of VOCs, 1.1 tons of SO2, and 28.9 tons of PM2.5. By applying these on-site emissions to CO-\nBRA under the “Other Industrial Processes” sector, we obtain a total public health cost of$14-21 million.\nAdditionally, the total annual energy consumption by the facility is 2074.88 million kWh as of Q2, 2024 [107].\nAssuming 84.2% of the energy comes from the electricity based on the company’s global average [108], we\nobtain the facility’s annual electricity consumption as 1746.63 million kWh. By using the average attribu-\ntion method, we further obtain an estimated health cost of$12-17 million associated with the electricity\nconsumption. Thus, the total health cost of the facility is$26-39 million.\nBy relocating the facility from Chandler, Arizona, to a planned site in Licking County, Ohio, and as-\nsuming the same emission level and electricity consumption, we can obtain the total health cost of$94-156\nmillion, including$23-36 million attributed to direct on-site emissions and$70-120 million attributed to\nelectricity consumption.\n27\n\nA.4 Energy Consumption for Training a Generative AI Model\nWe consider Llama-3.1 as an example generative AI model. According to the model card [36], the training\nprocess of Llama-3.1 (including 8B, 70B, and 405B) utilizes a cumulative of 39.3 million GPU hours of com-\nputation on H100-80GB hardware, and each GPU has a thermal design power of 700 watts. Considering\nMeta’s 2023 PUE of 1.08 [37] and excluding the non-GPU overhead for servers, we estimate the total train-\ning energy consumption as approximately 30 GWh. Our estimation method follows Meta’s guideline [36]\nand is conservative, as it excludes the substantial non-GPU energy overheads (e.g., CPUs) associated with\nserver operations.\nA.5 Average Emission for Each LA-NYC Round Trip by Car\nWe use the 2023 national average emission rate for light-duty vehicles (gasoline) provided by the U.S. De-\npartment of Transportation [104]. The emission rate accounts for tailpipe exhaust, tire wear and brake wear.\nSpecifically, the average PM2.5 emission rate is 0.008 grams/mile (including 0.004 grams/mile for exhaust,\n0.003 grams/mile for brake wear, and 0.001 grams/mile for tire wear), and the average NOx emission rate\nis 0.199 grams/mile for exhaust. We see that half of PM2.5 for light-duty vehicles comes from brake and tire\nwear (0.004 gram/miles), which are also produced by other types of vehicles including electric vehicles.\nThe distance for a round-trip between Los Angeles, California, and New York City, New York, is about 5,580\nmiles. Thus, the average auto emissions for each LA-NYC round trip are estimated as 44.64 grams of PM2.5\nand 1110.42 grams of NOx.\nA.6 State-wide Electricity Consumption by U.S. Data Centers in 2023\nWe show in Fig. 10 the state-wide data center electricity consumption in 2023 [5]. It can be seen that Virginia,\nTexas and California have the highest data center electricity consumption in 2023. The total national elec-\ntricity consumption reported by EPRI is slightly lower than the values in [4], and we scale it up accordingly\nin our calculations to ensure consistency.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPercentile\n(a)Electricity consumption map\nState\nElectricity\nConsumption\n(TWh)\nState\nElectricity\nConsumption\n(TWh)\nState\nElectricity\nConsumption\n(TWh)\nV A 33.85 OH 2.36 ID 0.15\nTX 21.81 SC 2.02 WI 0.15\nCA 9.33 WY 1.86 MD 0.10\nIL 7.45 KY 1.62 LA 0.08\nOR 6.41 CO 1.51 SD 0.07\nAZ 6.25 AL 1.49 ME 0.03\nIA 6.19 FL 1.38 NH 0.02\nGA 6.18 TN 1.33 RI 0.02\nWA 5.17 OK 1.23 KS <0.01\nPA 4.59 MA 1.06 AR <0.01\nNY 4.07 MO 0.97 DE <0.01\nNJ 4.04 MN 0.82 DC <0.01\nNE 3.96 MT 0.58 MS <0.01\nND 3.92 MI 0.53 VT <0.01\nNV 3.42 NM 0.40 WV <0.01\nNC 2.67 CT 0.26\nUT 2.56 IN 0.19\n(b)Electricity consumption by state (descending order)\nFigure 10:State-level electricity consumption of U.S. data centers in 2023 [5].\nB Additional Results for Health-Informed GLB\nB.1 Details of the experiment setup\nWe use Meta’s electricity consumption for each U.S. data center location in 2023 [37] for our experiments.\nTable 7 summarizes the baseline annual energy loadWi for each data centeri.

Here, we varyλand report the results forλ= 1.2andλ= 2.0in Tables 8\nand 9, respectively. Similar to Table 4, the potential reduction in health costs is significant. An increase inλ\ncorresponds to an expansion in the spatial flexibility, leading to a larger reduction in health cost. Specifically,\nwhenλ= 2.0, the health-informed algorithm achieves a reduction in health cost of over 40% compared\nto the baseline. In contrast, underλ= 2.0, the pure carbon-aware algorithm, which focuses exclusively\non optimizing carbon emissions with an infinite carbon pricep c =∞, can achieve a reduction in carbon\nemissions of approximately 12% relative to the baseline. This comparison highlights the great potential for\nhealth cost reduction and reinforces the importance of designingHI-GLB.\nTable 8:Comparison between health-informed and carbon-aware GLB (λ= 1.2)\nMetric Baseline Carbon-Aware GLB Health-Informed GLB\npc =$0/ton pc =$5/ton pc =$200/ton pc =$∞/ton HI-GLB(p e\ni,t = 0) HI-GLB\nHealth (Million$) 393.23 374.20 (-4.84%) 374.44 (-4.78%) 395.28 (0.52%) 404.72 (2.92%) 345.26 (-12.20%) 349.29 (-11.17%)\nEnergy (Million$) 756.50 732.06 (-3.23%) 732.30 (-3.20%) 747.88 (-1.14%) 761.20 (0.62%) 752.26 (-0.56%) 738.49 (-2.38%)\nCarbon (Million Ton) 6.60 6.68 (1.22%) 6.56 (-0.60%) 6.40 (-3.04%) 6.37 (-3.54%) 6.54 (-0.87%) 6.57 (-0.44%)\nTable 9:Comparison between health-informed and carbon-aware GLB (λ= 2.0)\nMetric Baseline Carbon-Aware GLB Health-Informed GLB\npc =$0/ton pc =$5/ton pc =$200/ton pc =$∞/ton HI-GLB(p e\ni,t = 0) HI-GLB\nHealth Cost (Million$) 393.23 368.10 (-6.39%) 409.67 (4.18%) 374.82 (-4.68%) 408.92 (3.99%) 221.38 (-43.70%) 223.96 (-43.05%)\nEnergy Cost (Million$) 756.50 702.16 (-7.18%) 702.69 (-7.11%) 723.42 (-4.37%) 767.59 (1.47%) 734.29 (-2.94%) 728.19 (-3.74%)\nCarbon (Million Ton) 6.60 6.72 (1.73%) 6.52 (-1.17%) 5.95 (-9.91%) 5.84 (-11.49%) 6.61 (0.19%) 6.55 (-0.71%)\n29", "metadata": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06288", "type": "paper", "year": "2024"}, "sections": [{"title": "Page 1", "paragraphs": [{"text": "The Unpaid Toll: Quantifying and Addressing the Public Health\nImpact of Data Centers\nYuelin Han\nUC Riverside\nZhifeng Wu\nUC Riverside\nPengfei Li\nRIT\nAdam Wierman\nCaltech\nShaolei Ren1\nUC Riverside\nAbstract\nThe surging demand for AI has led to a rapid expansion of energy-intensive data centers, impacting the\nenvironment through escalating carbon emissions and water consumption.

For example, by integrating\nmultimodal data from various sources, AI can provide effective tools and actionable insights for pandemic\npreparedness, disease prevention, healthcare optimization, and air quality management [1, 3]. However,\nthe surging demand for AI — particularly generative AI, as exemplified by the recent popularity of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) — has driven a rapid increase in computational needs, fueling the unprecedented\nexpansion of energy-intensive data centers. According to the recent Lawrence Berkeley National Lab re-\nport [4], AI training and inference are projected to become the dominant workloads and push the U.S. data\ncenter electricity consumption to account for 6.7–12.0% of the national total in 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.\nThe growing electricity demand of data centers has not only created significant stress on power grid\nstability [5,6], but also increasingly impacts the environment through escalating carbon emissions [7,8] and\nwater consumption [9]. These environmental impacts are driven primarily by the “expansion of AI products\nand services,” as recently acknowledged by technology companies in their sustainability reports [10]. To\nmitigate the challenges posed to both power grids and the environment, a range of strategies have been\nexplored, including grid-integrated data centers [6, 11], energy-efficient hardware and software [12–14],\nand the adoption of carbon-aware and water-efficient computing practices [9,15–17], among others.\nThe hidden toll of data centers.While the environmental footprint of data centers has garnered atten-\ntion, the public health burden, a hidden toll of data centers, has been largely overlooked.

Moreover, the distinct spatial-temporal hetero-\ngeneities of emission sources suggest that focusing solely on reducing data centers’ carbon footprints may\nnot minimize its emissions of criteria air pollutants or the resulting public health impacts (Section 6.2).\nExposure to criteria air pollutants is directly and causally linked to various adverse health outcomes,2 in-\ncluding premature mortality, lung cancer, asthma, heart attacks, cardiovascular diseases, and even cognitive\ndecline, especially for the elderly and vulnerable individuals with pre-existing conditions [20–22]. More-\nover, even short-term (hours to days) PM2.5 exposure is harmful and deadly, accounting for approximately\n1 million premature deaths per year from 2000 to 2019 and representing 2% of total global deaths [23].\nCriteria air pollutants are not confined to the immediate vicinity of their emission sources; they can travel\nhundreds of miles through a dispersion process (i.e., cross-state air pollution) [24, 25], impacting public\nhealth across vast regions. Further, PM 2.5 is considered “non-threshold,” i.e., there is no absolutely safe\nexposure level [26]. Thus, compliance with the national/regional air quality standards does not necessarily\nensure the air is healthy.\nGlobally, 4.2 million deaths were attributed to ambient (i.e., outdoor) air pollution in 2019 [27]. Air\npollution has become the second highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases [28]. Notably, according\nto the latest Global Burden of Disease report [29], along with high blood pressure and high blood sugar,\nambient particulate matter is placed among the leading risk factors for disease burden globally in every\nsocio-demographic group.\nImportantly, along with transportation and industrial activities, electricity generation is a key contributor\nto ambient air pollution with substantial public health impacts [28,30,31]. For example, a recent study [32]\nshows that, between 1999 and 2020, a total of 460,000excessdeaths were attributed to PM2.5 generated by coal-\nfired power plants alone in the U.S. As highlighted by the U.S. EPA [30], despite years of progress, power\nplants “remain a leading source of air, water, and land pollution that affects communities nationwide.” In\nEurope, the public health cost of air pollution from power plants is valued at approximately 1% of the gross\ndomestic product (GDP), according to the European Environment Agency’s study in 2024 [33].\nThe public health outcomes of data centers due to their emission of criteria air pollutants lead to various\nlosses, such as hospitalizations, medication usage, emergency room visits, school loss days, and lost work-\ndays. Nonetheless, despite recent policy efforts [34, 35], the tangible and growing public health impacts\nof data centers have remained under the radar, almost entirely omitted from today’s risk assessments and\nsustainability reports [10,36,37].\nQuantifying and addressing the public health impacts of data centers.In this paper, we uncover and\nquantify the hidden public health impacts of data centers. We introduce a principled methodology to model\nthe emission of criteria air pollutants associated with a computing task and data center across three distinct\nscopes: emissions from the maintenance and operation of backup generators (Scope 1), emissions from\nfossil fuel combustion for electricity generation (Scope 2), and emissions resulting from the manufacturing\nof server hardware (Scope 3). Then, we analyze the dispersion of criteria air pollutants and the resulting\npublic health impacts.\nAs the U.S. hosts nearly half of the world’s data centers [38] and the EPA data excludes other regions [39],\nour empirical study focuses on the 48 contiguous U.S. states plus Washington D.C.3 Our main results (Sec-\ntion 5) focus on the scope-1 and scope-2 health impacts of U.S. data centers and, specifically, LLM train-\ning. Using the reduced-complexity modeling tool COBRA (CO-Benefits Risk Assessment) provided by the\nEPA [39], our analysis demonstrates that driven by the growing demand for AI, the U.S. data centers could\ncontribute to, among others, approximately 600,000 asthma symptom cases and 1,300 premature deaths in\n2028, exceeding 1/3 of asthma deaths in the U.S. each year [40]. The overall public health costs could reach\nmore than$20 billion, rival or even top those of on-road emissions of the largest U.S. states such as California\n2While we focus on public health, we note that the impacts of criteria air pollutants extend beyond humans and include harms to\nenvironmentally sensitive areas, such as some national parks and wilderness areas which, classified as “Class 1 areas” under the Clean\nAir Act, require special air protection [19].\n3If located in countries with higher population densities, more pollutant-intensive electricity mixes, or less stringent air quality\nstandards, the same data centers would likely lead to more premature deaths and other adverse health impacts than in the U.S. We\nrecommend further research on the public health impact of non-U.S. data centers.\n2", "sentences": [{"text": "deep into lungs and cause serious health effects), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "Con-\ncretely, the

(c) Top-10 counties by the total health cost.\ncan provide comparable reliability at scale in real-world settings in the near term, as highlighted by the U.S.\nDepartment of Energy in its recent recommendations regarding AI data center infrastructures [6].\nConsequently, the vast majority of data centers, even including those newly built by major technology\ncompanies, depend on onsite diesel generators for backup power [6,60]. For example, in Northern Virginia\n(mostly in Loudoun, Prince William, and Fairfax), the number of permits for data center diesel generators\nhas increased by more than 70% since 2023 compared to the total number of permits issued between 2000 and\n2022 [60]. Importantly, nearly all the diesel generators are Tier 2, which have significantly higher emission\nrates than Tier 4 units [60, 61]. The total permitted annual emission limits for these diesel generators are\napproximately 13,000 tons of NOx, 1,400 tons of VOCs, 50 tons of SO2, and 600 tons of PM2.5, all in U.S. short\ntons.\nWhile diesel generators need to comply with air quality regulations and typically do not operate over\nextended periods of time, regular maintenance and testing are essential to ensure their operational reliabil-\nity. A recent report by the state of Virginia [42] found that the actual air pollutant emissions from backup\ngenerators at Virginia’s data centers reached approximately 7% of the total permitted amounts in 2023, pri-\nmarily for maintenance. Likewise, the actual emissions took up 3% to 12% of the permitted levels for some\ndata centers in Quincy, Washington [43].\nMoreover, the U.S. EPA recently issued a clarification that would allow data centers to run backup gen-\nerators for up to 50 hours a year (or roughly 10% of the permits that typically allow 500 hours per year) to\nparticipate in demand response—a program designed to reduce grid demand during peak hours, which is\nincreasingly activated as surging data center demand strains grid capacity [44]. This trend may necessitate\nextended reliance on backup generators [6]. What further adds to the public health impact is that many\ndata center generators in a region may operate simultaneously for demand response during grid capacity\nshortages, potentially resulting in a short-term spike in PM2.5 and NOx emissions that can be particularly\nharmful [6, 23, 48]. For example, from June 23 to 25, 2025, some data centers in Loudoun County, Virginia,\nwere instructed to run their on-site diesel generators for demand response, releasing large amounts of air\npollutants and “black smoke” [61].\nThe high emission rate from onsite generators, combined with extended operation for maintenance and\ndemand response beyond grid outages, could pose serious health risks, especially in regions with a con-\ncentration of large data centers. To illustrate this point, we consider the data centers’ onsite generators in\nVirginia. Assuming that the actual emissions are 10% of the permitted level as a reference case that re-\nflects both the historical reports and future demand response projections [42–44],4 the backup generators\ncould already cause 14,000 asthma symptom cases and 13-19 deaths each year among other health implica-\n4If the actual percentage isx%, our value will be approximately scaled by x\n10

We usep s = (p s\n1,· · ·, p s\nM)andp r\ni = (p r\ni,1,· · ·, p r\ni,M)\ndenote the quantities forMtypes of air pollutants attributed to the task at the emission source and at the\nreceptori, respectively, fori= 1,· · ·, N. Additionally, we useh i = (hi,1,· · ·, h i,H)andc i = (ci,1,· · ·, c i,H)\nto denote the incidences and economic costs associated withHtypes of health impacts at receptori, respec-\ntively, fori= 1,· · ·, N. With a slight abuse of notations, we reuse these symbols when modeling AI’s public\nhealth impacts across the three different scopes.\n4.1 Criteria Air Pollutants at the Source\nWe first model a computing task’s criteria air pollutants at the source across the three different scopes in\nSection 3.\n4.1.1 Scope 1.\nOnsite diesel generators are sized based on the data center power capacity, routinely tested to ensure a high\navailability of the entire data center, and used for demand response. Thus, the overall scope-1 air pollutants\nshould be attributed to each computing task based on its power allocation and duration. Suppose that the\noverall scope-1 emission by an AI data center under consideration is¯ps = (¯ps\n1,· · ·,¯p s\nM), forMtypes of air\npollutants, over a timespan ofT(e.g., one year).

Unlike carbon emissions that have a similar effect on climate change regardless of the\nemission source locations, the public health impact of criteria air pollutants heavily depends on the location\nof the emission source. Generally, the closer a receptor is to the source, the greater the air quality impact.\nFurthermore, the dispersion of air pollutants is influenced by meteorological conditions, such as wind speed\nand direction.\nIn practice, dispersion modeling tools are used to track the movement of air pollutants.

The parameterθcaptures the geographical conditions, emission source characteristics (e.g.,\nheight), and meteorological data [81]. We apply the dispersion model to each scope of air pollutants (Sec-\ntion 4.1) to estimate the corresponding pollutant concentrations at receptor regions.\nSeveral dispersion modeling tools are available, including AERMOD, PCAPS and InMAP with a reduced\ncomplexity [22,80,82,83]. For example, PCAPS (Pattern Constructed Air Pollution Surfaces), an advanced\nreduced-complexity model that provides representations of both primarily emitted PM2.5 and secondarily\nformed PM2.5 and ozone, is used in COBRA as a quick assessment of otherwise lengthy iterations and simu-\nlations of various pollution scenarios in terms of the annual average PM2.5 and seasonal average maximum\ndaily average 8-hour ozone [22, 83]. Even compared with state-of-the-science photochemical grid models,\nPCAPS provides similar prediction accuracies and can realistically capture the change in air pollution due to\nchanging emissions [83]. More specifically, for electric power sectors and on-road/highway vehicle sectors\n(the two sectors we consider in Section 5), the prediction results of PCAPS compare very well with photo-\nchemical model predictions, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.94, respectively [22,83].\n4.3 Converting Health Outcomes to Economic Costs\nBy assessing pollutant levelsp r\ni = (p r\ni,1,· · ·, p r\ni,M)and population size at each receptor regioni, we can\nestimate the incidences of health outcomesh i = (h i,1,· · ·, h i,H)and the corresponding public health cost\nci = (c i,1,· · ·, c i,H). The relations betweenp r\ni andh i and betweenh i andc i is captured by an exposure-\nresponse function and can be established based on epidemiology research [22]. For example, the premature\nmortality rate can be modeled as a log-linear function in terms of the PM2.5 level [84].\nFurther, by summing up the economic costs, we obtain quantitative estimates of the public health burden\nat both regional and national levels. It is important to note that the public health cost is not necessarily an\nout-of-pocket expense incurred by each individual, but rather reflects the estimated economic burden on a\npopulation to mitigate the adverse effects of pollutants within a specific region. Therefore, it is a quantitative\nscalar measure of the public health impact resulting from a particular pollutant-producing activity.\n4.4 End-to-End Modeling\nFollowing the end-to-end process shown in Fig. 1, we now briefly describe our modeling methodology to\nstudy the public health impact of U.S. data centers and AI training. The details are available in Appendix A.\nTo quantify data centers’ scope-1 and scope-2 air pollutant emissions, we use air quality permit data for\nonsite generators [60] and electricity consumption data, including both historical records and 2028 projec-\ntions, from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report [4].\nTo model the air pollutant dispersion and quantify health impacts, we use the latest COBRA (Desktop\nv5.1, as of October 2024) provided by the U.S. EPA [39]. COBRA integrates reduced-complexity air dis-\npersion modeling (including both primarily emitted PM 2.5 and secondly formed PM 2.5 and ozone [83])\nwith various concentration-response functions [22], offering a quantitative screening analysis particularly\nsuitable for large-scale health impacts.

cause, among others, approximately 600,000 asthma symptom cases and 1,300 premature deaths,\nexceeding 1/3 of asthma deaths in the U.S. each year [40]. The overall public health costs could reach more\nthan$20 billion, rival or even top those of on-road emissions of the largest U.S. states such as California\nwith∼35 million registered vehicles [41]. Importantly, the health costs are unevenly distributed across\ncounties and communities, particularly affecting low-income counties that could experience approximately\n200x per-household health costs than others. Moreover, depending on the locations, training an AI model of\nthe Llama-3.1 scale can produce an amount of air pollutants equivalent to driving a passenger car for more\nthan 10,000 LA-NYC round trips, resulting in a health cost that even exceeds 120% of the training electricity\ncost.\n5.1 Public Health Impact of U.S. Data Centers\nWe now present our public health impact analysis for U.S. data centers in aggregate, beginning with the\nhistorical analysis from 2019 to 2023 and highlighting the uneven distribution of health impacts, followed\nby a 2028 projection. The overall trend is shown in Fig. 4, which demonstrates a significant increase in the\npublic health impact of U.S. data centers from 2023 to 2028. Specifically, the surging demand for AI data\ncenters in the U.S. has outweighed the power plant emission efficiency improvement, potentially tripling\nthe public health cost from 2023 to 2028.\nWe present the details in Table 1 and see that scope-2 health cost dominates the scope-1 cost. 6 This\nsuggests that while using alternative fuels for onsite generators can help improve local air quality around\ndata centers, greater health benefits can be achieved by powering data centers with pollutant-free electricity\nsources.\nMobile sources, including vehicles, marine engines, and generators, collectively account for more than\nhalf of the air pollutants in the U.S., with vehicles being a primary contributor [89,90]. Thus, to contextualize\nthe public health costs of data centers, we compare them to on-road emissions in the three largest U.S. states\n(California, Texas, and Florida). In particular, California, which has about 35 million registered vehicles,\nexhibits the highest public health cost from on-road emissions among all U.S. states [39,41]. In the COBRA\nmodel, on-road emissions are categorized under the “Highway Vehicles” sector and include both tailpipe\nexhaust and tire and brake wear. The details of calculating on-road emissions and the corresponding health\ncosts are provided in Appendix A.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, in 2023, the total public health cost of U.S. data centers is 42% of that from California’s\non-road emissions. Due to the tightening air pollutant regulations [91], the health costs of on-road emissions\nhave generally decreased from 2019 to 2028. However, with rapid growth, the public health impact of U.S.\ndata centers is projected to rival or even surpass that of California’s on-road emissions by 2028, underscoring\nthe need for greater attention to the growing public health impacts of the data center industry.\n5.1.1 Historical analysis: 2019-2023.\nTable 1 shows the public health cost of U.S. data centers from 2019 to 2023 as a reference. Even at the\nbeginning of the generative AI boom, the U.S. data centers have already resulted in a total public health cost\nof about$6.7 billion, or$47.5 per household, in 2023. This is equivalent to approximately 44% of the data\ncenters’ total electricity cost.\nNext, we show in Fig. 5 the county-level total public health cost of U.S. data centers from 2019 to 2023,\nwhich exhibits significant spatial variability. In particular, populated counties located downwind of power\nplants supplying electricity to data centers tend to experience higher health costs, reflecting the transport of\nair pollutants across regions. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) in Fig. 5b highlights that while\nmany counties incur relatively low health costs, a small fraction of counties bear substantially higher impacts.\nTable 5c further identifies the top-10 counties with the highest total health costs, illustrating how local pop-\nulation density and proximity to power generation infrastructure combine to amplify public health risks in\nspecific communities.\n6We use the “mid (low, high)” format to represent the midrange, low and high estimates offered by COBRA.

IR\nrepresents “County-to-Nation Per-Household Median Income Ratio.”\ndifferent communities in terms of the public health cost suggests that we need to carefully examine the local\nand regional health impacts of data centers and improve public health equity to enable truly responsible\ncomputing.\nFurthermore, many of the hardest-hit communities neither host large data centers nor directly benefit\neconomically from AI data centers, such as through tax revenues. For example, several counties in West\nVirginia are among the most affected, because many coal-fired power plants in West Virginia are supplying\nelectricity to data centers in the neighboring state of Virginia [4, 5]. By contrast, despite hosting a large\nnumber of data centers and incurring high total health costs due to its large population, California’s clean\npower grid results in some of the lowest per-household health impacts in the country.\n5.1.3 Projection for 2028.\nAccording to a recent Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) report [4], the U.S. data center elec-\ntricity consumption is expected to increase from 4.4% of the total national electricity use in 2023 to 6.7–12.0%\nin 2028, depending on the growth trajectory of AI adoption. At the same time, the projected rise in peak\npower demand is accompanied by massive installations of onsite backup diesel generators to ensure relia-\nbility during grid contingencies [60].\nThis substantial growth in electricity demand and onsite generation is expected to offset, and in fact\noutweigh, the gradual pollution emission intensity reductions anticipated from the power sector. As a result,\nthe total public health costs attributable to data center operations are projected to potentially triple from 2023\nto 2028. Quantitatively, based on the low- and high-growth scenarios considered in [4], the total public\nhealth impact of U.S. data centers is estimated to reach$11.7 billion and$20.9 billion in 2028, respectively.\nUnder the high-growth scenario, the resulting health burden could rival or exceed that of on-road emissions\nin the largest U.S. state. This highlights the growing health externalities of U.S. data centers at a national\nscale.\nTable 2:The public health cost of training a large AI model in selected U.S. data centers.\nLocation

As the scope-2 impact is dominant and the power allocated to train Llama-3.1 is unknown to\ndetermine scope-1 impacts, we focus on scope-2 health costs associated with the electricity consumption.\nWhile we use Meta’s Llama-3.1 training electricity consumption and U.S. data center locations as an example,\nour results should be interpreted as the estimated public health impact of training a general LLM with a\ncomparable scale of Llama-3.1.\nWe show the results in Table 2. It can be seen that the total health cost can even exceed 120% of the\nelectricity cost and vary widely depending on the training data center locations. For example, the total\nhealth cost is only$0.23 million in Oregon, whereas the cost will increase dramatically to$2.5 million in Iowa\ndue to various factors, such as the wind direction and the pollutant emission rate for electricity generation\n[76]. Additionally, depending on the locations, training an AI model of the Llama-3.1 scale can produce an\namount of air pollutants equivalent to more than 10,000 LA-NYC round trips by car.\nThe results highlight that the public health impact of AI model training is highly location-dependent.\nCombined with the spatial flexibility of model training, they suggest that AI model developers should take\ninto account potential health impacts when choosing data center locations for training.\n5.3 Location-Dependent Public Health Impacts of Two Technology Companies\nWe further highlight locational dependency of public health impacts by considering two major technology\ncompanies’ U.S. data center locations in 2023, excluding their leased colocation data centers whose locations\nare proprietary. We name these two companies A and B, respectively. These two companies do not have\nsame data center locations. While company B discloses its per-location electricity usage [37], company A\ndoes not.

We consider location-based emission\naccounting without taking into account renewable energy credits these two companies apply to offset their\ngrid electricity consumption (see “Location-based emission” in Section 4.1.2).\nWe see from Fig. 7 that the two companies have significant differences in terms of the per-household\nhealth cost distribution and most-affected counties.

Here, we leverage the unique spatial load flexibility\nof geographically distributed data centers to demonstrate the benefits of health-informed computing as a\nproof of concept.\nHealth-Informed GLB.Specifically, we study health-informed GLB (HI-GLB) to address the public health\nburden of data center operation. We consider a discrete-time model of durationTand measure the work-\nloads in terms of their energy demand. For the sake of examining the impact of spatial flexibility, we assume\nthat the energy loads (i.e., workloads) can be flexibly distributed across a set ofNdata centers denoted as\nN={1,2, . . . , N}. In each timet∈ {1,2, . . . , T}, the total energy demand isM t, andw i,t represents the load\nassigned to data centeri. We usel i to represent the default load capacity of data centeri, and introduce a\nslackness parameterλ≥1to represent the ability of each data center to accept loads in excess of its default\ncapacity. Thus, the greater the value ofλ, the more spatial flexibility the operator has. In each timet, we\nusep e\ni,t andp h\ni,t to denote the electricity price and health price at data centeri, respectively.\nThe health priceph\ni,t depends on the emission source of criteria air pollutants (e.g., power plants’ emission\nrates and their locations), air pollutant dispersion, and estimates of adverse health outcomes and resulting\ncosts attributed to the increased air pollutant concentration in each region [22]. Thus, the health price\nquantifies the ultimate health burden imposed on affected populations and is measured in terms of economic\ncosts for each unit of electricity consumption. It varies over time due to fluctuations in the grid’s generation\nmix and changing meteorological conditions. Third-party organizations such as WattTime [98] provide real-\ntime estimates of the marginal health price of electricity across 114 power balancing regions in the U.S., while\nthe EPA [100] reports annualized average health prices for electricity in 14 broader regions nationwide.\nOur goal is to minimize the sum of electricity costsPT\nt=1\nPN\ni=1 pe\ni,t ·w i,t and health costsPT\nt=1\nPN\ni=1 ph\ni,t ·\nwi,t across all regions.

This\nstands in sharp contrast toHI-GLB, which achieves a substantial∼26% reduction in health cost compared to\nthe baseline, demonstrating that environmental metrics such as carbon are insufficient for mitigating health\nimpacts unless public health considerations are explicitly integrated into the optimization process. More-\nover, compared to the pure health-informed GLB that sets a zero electricity price (p e = 0),HI-GLBonly\nslightly increases the health cost from$290 million to$292 million, further demonstrating that considering\nthe health price can effectively drive healthier GLB decisions while maintaining low cost.\nAt the same time, the pure carbon-aware GLB algorithm achieves a maximum reduction in carbon re-\nduction of 7.23% while increasing the health burden and electricity cost relative to the baseline.

explain the results, we analyze the correlation between health\ncosts and carbon emissions across the 13 regions where Meta operates its U.S. data centers. Figure 9b\npresents a scatter plot illustrating the correlation between the annual average carbon emission rate and\nhealth price across various regions. The Pearson correlation coefficient between different locations’ health\nprices and carbon emissions is approximately -0.35, indicating a negative relationship. This suggests a po-\ntential conflict between efforts to optimize carbon emissions and those aimed at improving health outcomes\nvia GLB. Furthermore, as highlighted by the spatial patterns in Figure 9b, the health prices exhibit a signif-\nicantly higher degree of spatial variability compared to carbon emissions across regions. This discrepancy\nfurther reinforces the point that focusing solely on optimizing environmental factors, such as carbon emis-\nsions, may not effectively reduce health costs, underscoring the importance of integrating health-informed\noptimization strategies to achieve more comprehensive benefits.\n7 Our Recommendations\nWe provide additional recommendations to address the growing public health impact of data centers.\nRecommendation 1: Standardization of Reporting Protocols\nDespite their immediate and tangible impacts on public health, criteria air pollutants have been entirely\noverlooked in AI model cards and sustainability reports published by technology companies [10, 36, 37].\nThe absence of such critical information adds substantial challenges to accurately identifying specific AI\ndata centers as a key root cause of public health burdens and could potentially pose hidden risks to public\nhealth. To enhance transparency and lay the foundation for truly responsible AI, we recommend stan-\ndardization of reporting protocols for criteria air pollutants and the public health impacts across different\nregions. Concretely, criteria air pollutants can be categorized into three different scopes (Section 3), and\nreported following the greenhouse gas protocol widely adopted by technology companies [10,37,78].\nJust as addressing scope-2 and scope-3 carbon emissions is important for mitigating climate change, it\nis equally crucial to address scope-2 and scope-3 criteria air pollutants to promote public health through-\nout the power generation and hardware manufacturing processes in support of AI. For instance, power\nplants are dispatched based on real-time energy demand to ensure grid stability. As a result, only focusing\non regulating scope-2 air pollutants at the power plant level fails to address the root cause — electricity\nconsumption — and overlooks the potential of demand-side solutions. In contrast, recognizing scope-2 air\npollutants and their associated public health impacts enables novel opportunities for health-informed AI,\nwhich, as detailed below, taps into demand-side flexibilities to holistically reduce AI’s adverse public health\nimpacts.\nRecommendation 2: Attention to All\nCounties and communities located near AI data centers or supplying electricity to them often experience\nmost significant health burdens. Nonetheless, these health impacts can extend far beyond the immedi-\nate vicinity, affecting communities hundreds of miles away [24, 25]. For example, the health impact of\nbackup generators in northern Virginia can affect several surrounding states (Fig. 2a) and even reach as\nfar as Florida.\nWhile the health impact on communities where data centers operate is increasingly recognized, there\nhas been very little, if any, attention paid to other impacted communities that bear substantial public health\nburdens.

"paragraphs": [{"text": "Recommendation 3: Promoting Public Health Equity\nThe public health impact of AI is highly unevenly distributed across different counties and communities,\ndisproportionately affecting certain (often low-income) communities [31, 103]. For example, as shown in\nTable 6c, all the top-10 most impacted counties in the U.S. have lower median household incomes than the\nnational median value. The ratio of the highest county-level per-household health cost to the lowest cost\nis approximately 200. Therefore, it is imperative to address the substantial health impact disparities across\ncommunities.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we quantify and address the overlooked public health impact of data centers. We introduce\na principled methodology to model these lifecycle pollutant emissions and quantify their associated public\nhealth impacts. Our findings suggest that the total annual public health burden of U.S. data centers could\nexceed$20 billion by 2028, approaching or even surpassing the impacts of on-road vehicle emissions in\nCalifornia. Importantly, these health costs are not evenly distributed: disadvantaged communities bear a\ndisproportionate share, with per-household impacts potentially up to 200 times higher than in less-affected\nareas. This highlights the need for targeted mitigation strategies. To this end, we propose health-informed\ncomputing, a framework that explicitly incorporates public health risk as a key metric when scheduling data\ncenter workloads, enabling more informed and equitable operational decisions.\nMore broadly, we recommend the adoption of standardized reporting protocols for the public health\ncosts of data centers, alongside policies that ensure attention to all impacted communities, thereby support-\ning responsible, sustainable, and inclusive deployment of AI infrastructure.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Susan Wierman for providing comments on an initial draft of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The total permitted site-level annual emission limits are approxi-\nmately 13,000 tons of NOx, 1,400 tons of VOCs, 50 tons of SO2, and 600 tons of PM2.5, all in U.S. short tons.\nBy assuming that the actual emissions are 10% of the permitted level, the data centers in Virginia could\nalready cause approximately 14,000 asthma symptom cases and 13-19 deaths each year, among other health\nimplications, resulting in a total annual public health burden of$220-300 million, including$190-260 mil-\nlion incurred in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and\nWashington D.C., as estimated by COBRA under the “Fuel Combustion: Industrial” sector.\nThe scope-1 emission information for data centers in other states is not always publicly available. Thus,\nwhen estimating scope-1 emissions for data centers in another state, we apply the emission rate (tons/MWh)\nderived from Virginia’s data and multiply it by the energy consumption of data centers in that states. Al-\nthough this approach may introduce some estimation errors, the impact is expected to be limited because\nscope-2 health costs are substantially more dominant.\nA.2 Data Centers’ Scope-2 Public Health Impact\nThe locations of emission sources depend on the power plants supplying electricity to data centers. To\nevaluate the public health impacts of U.S. data centers, we focus on average attribution method, which\nis also the standard methodology of carbon emission accounting used by technology companies in their\nsustainability reports [10,37,78].\nWe first calculate the total data center electricity consumptioneDC and the overall electricity consump-\ntion (including non-data center loads)e T otal within each electricity region. The U.S. electricity grid is di-\nvided into 14 regions following the A Voided Emissions and geneRation Tool (A VERT, the latest version v4.3\nas of October 2024) provided by the EPA [76]. We use the state-level data center electricity consumption\ndistribution for 2023 provided by EPRI [5], scale it by the U.S. total data center electricity consumption in\n2019-2023 and for the 2028 projection based on data provided by [4], and then distribute state-level electric-\nity consumption to relevant electricity regions following the state-to-region electricity apportionment used\nby A VERT.\nWe calculate the percentagex% = eDC\neT otal\nof the data center electricity consumption with respect to the\noverall electricity consumption for each electricity region. The relationship between the health impact and\nemission reduction in COBRA is approximately linear. Thus, we apply a reduction byx%to the baseline\nemissions of all the power plants within the respective electricity region in COBRA and estimate the corre-\nsponding county-level health impacts, including health outcomes and costs.\nWhen assessing the health impact of generative AI training, we follow the same approach, except for\nchanging the total data center electricity consumption to the AI model training electricity consumption.\nA.3 Public Health Impact of a Semiconductor Facility\nAlthough semiconductor manufacturing facilities are subject to air quality regulations [74], they still pose\nsignificant risks, affecting populations across large regions. Maricopa County, AZ, has been an EPA-designated\nnon-attainment area for several years due to its failures to meet federal air quality standards [106]. The es-\ntablishment of multiple semiconductor facilities in such areas could further exacerbate air quality issues.\nWe consider a semiconductor manufacturing facility located in Ocotillo, a neighborhood in Chandler,\nArizona [107]. By averaging the rolling 12-month air pollutant emission levels listed in the recent air qual-\nity monitoring report (as of October, 2024) [18], we obtain the annual emissions as follows: 150.4 tons of\nNOx, 82.7 tons of VOCs, 1.1 tons of SO2, and 28.9 tons of PM2.5. By applying these on-site emissions to CO-\nBRA under the “Other Industrial Processes” sector, we obtain a total public health cost of$14-21 million.\nAdditionally, the total annual energy consumption by the facility is 2074.88 million kWh as of Q2, 2024 [107].\nAssuming 84.2% of the energy comes from the electricity based on the company’s global average [108], we\nobtain the facility’s annual electricity consumption as 1746.63 million kWh. By using the average attribu-\ntion method, we further obtain an estimated health cost of$12-17 million associated with the electricity\nconsumption. Thus, the total health cost of the facility is$26-39 million.\nBy relocating the facility from Chandler, Arizona, to a planned site in Licking County, Ohio, and as-\nsuming the same emission level and electricity consumption, we can obtain the total health cost of$94-156\nmillion, including$23-36 million attributed to direct on-site emissions and$70-120 million attributed to\nelectricity

An increase inλ\ncorresponds to an expansion in the spatial flexibility, leading to a larger reduction in health cost. Specifically,\nwhenλ= 2.0, the health-informed algorithm achieves a reduction in health cost of over 40% compared\nto the baseline. In contrast, underλ= 2.0, the pure carbon-aware algorithm, which focuses exclusively\non optimizing carbon emissions with an infinite carbon pricep c =∞, can achieve a reduction in carbon\nemissions of approximately 12% relative to the baseline. This comparison highlights the great potential for\nhealth cost reduction and reinforces the importance of designingHI-GLB.\nTable 8:Comparison between health-informed and carbon-aware GLB (λ= 1.2)\nMetric Baseline Carbon-Aware GLB Health-Informed GLB\npc =$0/ton pc =$5/ton pc =$200/ton pc =$∞/ton HI-GLB(p e\ni,t = 0) HI-GLB\nHealth (Million$) 393.23 374.20 (-4.84%) 374.44 (-4.78%) 395.28 (0.52%) 404.72 (2.92%) 345.26 (-12.20%) 349.29 (-11.17%)\nEnergy (Million$) 756.50 732.06 (-3.23%) 732.30 (-3.20%) 747.88 (-1.14%) 761.20 (0.62%) 752.26 (-0.56%) 738.49 (-2.38%)\nCarbon (Million Ton) 6.60 6.68 (1.22%) 6.56 (-0.60%) 6.40 (-3.04%) 6.37 (-3.54%) 6.54 (-0.87%) 6.57 (-0.44%)\nTable 9:Comparison between health-informed and carbon-aware GLB (λ= 2.0)\nMetric Baseline Carbon-Aware GLB Health-Informed GLB\npc =$0/ton pc =$5/ton pc =$200/ton pc =$∞/ton HI-GLB(p e\ni,t = 0) HI-GLB\nHealth Cost (Million$) 393.23 368.10 (-6.39%) 409.67 (4.18%) 374.82 (-4.68%) 408.92 (3.99%) 221.38 (-43.70%) 223.96 (-43.05%)\nEnergy Cost (Million$) 756.50 702.16 (-7.18%) 702.69 (-7.11%) 723.42 (-4.37%) 767.59 (1.47%) 734.29 (-2.94%) 728.19 (-3.74%)\nCarbon (Million Ton) 6.60 6.72 (1.73%) 6.52 (-1.17%) 5.95 (-9.91%) 5.84 (-11.49%) 6.61 (0.19%) 6.55 (-0.71%)\n29", "sentences": [{"text": "Table 7:Information about Meta’s U.S.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "data center locations in 2023\nLocation Energy(MWh) Electricity Pricep e ($/MWh) Health Pricep h ($/MWh) Carbon Intensityr c(ton/MWh)\nHuntsville, AL 614198 71.0 49.49 0.59\nStanton Springs, GA 968565 68.8 19.35 0.58\nDeKalb, IL 138965 82.0 51.72 0.58\nAltoona, IA 1243306 69.1 57.86 0.65\nSarpy, NE 1148091 76.3 36.72 0.56\nLos Lunas, NM 1110100 57.5 18.96 0.68\nForest City, NC 507068 71.5 54.64 0.66\nNew Albany, OH 793063 70.3 54.32 0.61\nPrineville, OR 1375321 75.2 13.31 0.65\nGallatin, TN 116520 62.3 49.49 0.59\nFort Worth, TX 1029570 66.0 44.56 0.51\nEagle Mountain, UT 787740 69.9 21.93 0.74\nHenrico, V A 805061 89.2 54.37 0.61\nIn our study, we use the WattTime data from 0:00 on January 1, 2023, to 23:55 on December 31, 2023.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "The actual time interval for our experiment is 1 hour, where the 5-minute data points are averaged hourly\nto computep h\ni,t andr c\ni,t,∀t={1,2, .", "metadata": {}}, {"text": ".", "metadata": {}}, {"text": ".", "metadata": {}}, {"text": ", T}, withT= 8760.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "B.2 Sensitivity analysis of capacity slacknessλ\nThe parameterλ≥1represents the capacity slackness to accept additional loads: The greaterλ, the more\nspatial flexibility there is.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "Here, we varyλand report the results forλ= 1.2andλ= 2.0in Tables 8\nand 9, respectively.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "Similar to Table 4, the potential reduction in health costs is significant.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "An increase inλ\ncorresponds to an expansion in the spatial flexibility, leading to a larger reduction in health cost.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "Specifically,\nwhenλ= 2.0, the health-informed algorithm achieves a reduction in health cost of over 40% compared\nto the baseline.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "In contrast, underλ= 2.0, the pure carbon-aware algorithm, which focuses exclusively\non optimizing carbon emissions with an infinite carbon pricep c =∞, can achieve a reduction in carbon\nemissions of approximately 12% relative to the baseline.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "This comparison highlights the great potential for\nhealth cost reduction and reinforces the importance of designingHI-GLB.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "Table 8:Comparison between health-informed and carbon-aware GLB (λ= 1.2)\nMetric Baseline Carbon-Aware GLB Health-Informed GLB\npc =$0/ton pc =$5/ton pc =$200/ton pc =$∞/ton HI-GLB(p e\ni,t = 0) HI-GLB\nHealth (Million$) 393.23 374.20 (-4.84%) 374.44 (-4.78%) 395.28 (0.52%) 404.72 (2.92%) 345.26 (-12.20%) 349.29 (-11.17%)\nEnergy (Million$) 756.50 732.06 (-3.23%) 732.30 (-3.20%) 747.88 (-1.14%) 761.20 (0.62%) 752.26 (-0.56%) 738.49 (-2.38%)\nCarbon (Million Ton) 6.60 6.68 (1.22%) 6.56 (-0.60%) 6.40 (-3.04%) 6.37 (-3.54%) 6.54 (-0.87%) 6.57 (-0.44%)\nTable 9:Comparison between health-informed and carbon-aware GLB (λ= 2.0)\nMetric Baseline Carbon-Aware GLB Health-Informed GLB\npc =$0/ton pc =$5/ton pc =$200/ton pc =$∞/ton HI-GLB(p e\ni,t = 0) HI-GLB\nHealth Cost (Million$) 393.23 368.10 (-6.39%) 409.67 (4.18%) 374.82 (-4.68%) 408.92 (3.99%) 221.38 (-43.70%) 223.96 (-43.05%)\nEnergy Cost (Million$) 756.50 702.16 (-7.18%) 702.69 (-7.11%) 723.42 (-4.37%) 767.59 (1.47%) 734.29 (-2.94%) 728.19 (-3.74%)\nCarbon (Million Ton) 6.60 6.72 (1.73%) 6.52 (-1.17%) 5.95 (-9.91%) 5.84 (-11.49%) 6.61 (0.19%) 6.55 (-0.71%)\n29", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"page": 29}}], "metadata": {"page": 29}}]}
