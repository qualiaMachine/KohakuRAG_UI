Much of this\ndebate has concentrated on direct impacts—energy and water usage\nin data centers, e-waste from frequent hardware upgrades—without\naddressing the significant indirect effects. This paper examines how\nthe problem of Jevons’ Paradox applies to AI, whereby efficiency\ngains may paradoxically spur increased consumption. We argue\nthat understanding these second-order impacts requires an inter-\ndisciplinary approach, combining lifecycle assessments with socio-\neconomic analyses. Rebound effects undermine the assumption\nthat improved technical efficiency alone will ensure net reductions\nin environmental harm. Instead, the trajectory of AI’s impact also\nhinges on business incentives and market logics, governance and\npolicymaking, and broader social and cultural norms. We contend\nthat a narrow focus on direct emissions misrepresents AI’s true\nclimate footprint, limiting the scope for meaningful interventions.\nWe conclude with recommendations that address rebound effects\nand challenge the market-driven imperatives fueling uncontrolled\nAI growth. By broadening the analysis to include both direct and\nindirect consequences, we aim to inform a more comprehensive,\nevidence-based dialogue on AI’s role in the climate crisis.\nKeywords\nArtificial intelligence, Environmental Impacts, Lifecycle Assess-\nment, Rebound Effects, Sustainability\nACM Reference Format:\nAlexandra Sasha Luccioni, Emma Strubell, and Kate Crawford. 2025.

Some maintain that its\npotential to accelerate sustainable breakthroughs will exceed its en-\nvironmental costs by increasing renewable energy production and\ntransmission or aiding in the design of more sustainable materials\n[76, 99]. Others point to the soaring resource demands of large-\nscale AI models and their negative environmental impacts from\nnon-renewable energy use, water consumption, and extraction of\nminerals [24, 28, 45, 57]. These opposing positions tend to center on\nthe technology’s direct impacts, measured in energy consumption\nand greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from data centers, or in the\ne-waste that accumulates as hardware becomes obsolete.\nYet a critical dimension of AI’s climate footprint lies outside these\ndirect resource and emissions calculations. Recent work on indirect\nimpacts [63] warns of potential “rebound effects”, whereby gains in\nefficiency spur higher overall consumption. These second-order ef-\nfects challenge the presumption that purely technical optimizations\nalone will deliver sufficient climate benefits. Cost savings achieved\nby more efficient AI hardware, for example, can spur increased\ndemand for new AI functionalities, which in turn drive further\nhardware upgrades and increase costs. Economists refer to such\ntransformations as Jevons’ Paradox, which was proposed in the\n19th century by economist William Stanley Jevons, who observed\nthat as coal use became more efficient, it was also paradoxically\nleading to an increase, and not a decrease, in the consumption of\ncoal across different industries [60]. The addition of increasingly\nefficient AI to systems from commerce to transportation can have\nfar-reaching effects on our societies, our behaviors, and the future\npaths available to us in the race against climate change.\nThis system-level complexity underscores the inadequacy of the\nquestion, “Is AI net positive or net negative for the climate?” In-\nstead, we adopt an analytic approach that includes the intersecting\nsocial, political, and economic contexts in which AI systems are\ndeveloped and deployed. Although efficiency has been a defining\nethos in recent AI research, reflected in “scaling laws” that promise\never-more-powerful models [64], effective climate action requires\ngrappling with how these systems reshape markets, cultural norms,\nand policy priorities. Thus, understanding rebound effects requires\ndrawing on both qualitative and quantitative methods, drawn from\ncomputer science, economics and the social sciences, as they hinge\nnot on algorithmic design but human adaptation and use patterns.\nAdopting an interdisciplinary approach allows for both a rigorous\nlifecycle accounting of direct effects as well as understanding the\nsocial behaviors that AI can induce or displace.\nThis paper aims to bridge the gap in the existing literature by,\nfirst, providing a brief overview of the debate about AI’s direct pos-\nitive and negative impacts on the environment (§2). We follow this\n\nFAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Luccioni et al.\nwith an in-depth exploration of AI’s indirect impacts, including sys-\ntemic rebound effects, and propose actionable strategies to mitigate\nthem (§3). We conclude by proposing promising directions for fu-\nture exploration and research toward improving our understanding\nof the full spectrum of AI’s impacts on the environment. In short,\nwe argue that meaningfully contending with AI’s climate impacts\nrequires grappling with both direct and indirect effects. Otherwise,\nthe industry risks pinning its hopes on technical efficiency gains\nalone without recognizing the social, cultural, and economic con-\ntexts that materially shape technology uses. Our aim is to support\nthe field in moving away from polarized extremes and toward a\nnuanced position that acknowledges the state of climate change\nand the pressing need to manage all of AI’s climate impacts. By ex-\npanding this dialogue and grounding it in evidence across multiple\ndisciplines, we can develop strategies that genuinely address AI’s\nrole in environmental sustainability.\n2 AI and the environment\nThe environmental impacts of AI were largely overlooked until\nrecent years. Now these issues figure prominently in both scientific\ndebates and public media. Central to this discourse is the question\nof whether AI’s capacity to help mitigate climate change, e.g. by\noptimizing energy use or discovering sustainable materials, truly\nexceeds its environmental costs in terms of energy consumption,\nwater usage, and mineral extraction. Some contend that AI’s poten-\ntial benefits justify widespread deployment across various climate-\nfocused applications, whereas others caution that unrestrained\nexpansion may ultimately be more harmful than beneficial. In this\nsection, we review these competing perspectives on AI’s positive\nand negative environmental impacts as presented in academic and\nindustry discussions.\n2.1 Arguments that AI is a net climate negative\nResearch into AI’s total usage of natural resources is still nascent,\nbut initial studies have highlighted significant concerns across mul-\ntiple domains of direct impact. Papers have addressed carbon emis-\nsions from training large models [67, 69, 70, 120], water consump-\ntion for cooling servers [ 52, 80], and the mining of minerals for\ntechnical infrastructure [ 24]. In the present section, we present\nthe different directions of study pursued in terms of AI’s negative\nenvironmental impacts and discuss the observations that have been\nput forward.\nAI is using increasing amounts of energy, most of it generated from\nnonrenewable sources. Data from the International Energy Agency\n(IEA) has provided the strongest international benchmark. They\nnote that the electricity demand from data centers, driven heavily by\nAI training and inference, is currently at 2% of total global electricity\nand will more than double by 2026, surpassing Canada’s national\npower use [45, 56]. This growth is putting strain on energy grids\naround the world and resulting in many countries, such as Ireland\nand the Netherlands, placing a moratorium on the construction of\nnew data centers in certain regions. In the United States, the demand\nfor electricity has surged in the past twelve months – according to\na recent report into the national grid, electric utilities have nearly\ndoubled their forecasts of how much additional power they will\nneed in the next five years [137].\nAI data centers are putting stress on already strained aquifers glob-\nally. The construction and operation of data centers requires vast\nquantities of water, which is used for cooling servers to prevent\nthem from overheating by circulating cool water through radiators.\nThis cooling process requires a constant supply of cool, fresh water,\nwhich is heated up during the process, causing a significant portion\nof it to evaporate, whereas the rest has to be cooled and filtered\nbefore being reused or discharged back into local aquifers [ 96].\nCorporate reports have revealed the scale of water demand in-\ncreases, with Microsoft reporting a 34% increase in global water\nconsumption between 2021 and 2022, topping 1.7 billion gallons,\nwhile Google observed a 20% uptick in the same period [ 42, 78].\nOther studies have sought to estimate water usage at the level of\nindividual AI models, with one paper suggesting that 10–50 queries\non GPT-3 consumes around half a liter of water [68]. By 2050, 50%\nof the world’s population is projected to live in a region affected by\nwater scarcity [14], but the full impacts of data center water usage\nis unknown as “the entire data centre industry suffers from a lack\nof transparency” [80].\nThe rare earth minerals needed to produce computing hardware\nare mined in unsustainable and opaque ways. Metals such as cobalt,\nlithium, coltan, gallium, copper, tungsten, and germanium are re-\nquired for AI hardware and infrastructure. Individual studies have\nlooked at the impacts of mining lithium cobalt, copper, and rare\nearth for consumer devices (smartphones, tablets) to the GPUs and\nTPUs powering large-scale AI model training and addressed the\nresulting environmental damage and impact on local conflict and\nwar. One study specifically addressed mining on indigenous lands,\nwith 54% of technology-critical materials drawn from what they\ndescribe as Indigenous or peasant territory, while 62% were ex-\ntracted from drought-prone zones [86]. The mining of these metals\nalso comes with a cost to the environment, given the tonnes of\nearth that have to be mined, the radiation produced, and the toxic\nwaste created [28]. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Com-\npany (TSMC), the company that manufactures the GPUs designed\nby NVIDIA (among other companies), citing the complexity of their\nsupply chains and proprietary information of its customers, also\ndoes not provide granular data for their suppliers nor their internal\nprocesses (such as chemical purification) [136], meaning that it is\nimpossible to carry out a full life cycle analysis of the hundreds of\nthousands of GPUs that are designed and manufactured each year\nand used to train and deploy AI models.\nAI is responsible for a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-\nsions. Despite significant efforts by AI-driven companies to invest\nin renewable energy and meet net-zero emissions pledges, all ev-\nidence indicates that direct GHG emissions due to AI are on the\nrise. Many AI companies are reporting significantly higher GHG\nemissions over earlier baselines, likely driven by increases in de-\nvelopment and use of generative AI. For example, in their 2024\nannual environmental sustainability report (ESG), Google reports\na 48% increase in GHG emissions since 2019 which they attribute\nprimarily to “increases in data center energy consumption” [42],\nBaidu reports 32.6% increase in GHG emissions over 2021 citing\n“rapid development of LLMs” posing “severe challenges” to their\ndevelopment of green data centers [9], and Microsoft cites a 29.1%\n\nFrom Efficiency Gains to Rebound Effects FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece\nincrease since 2020 “as [they] continue to invest in the infrastruc-\nture needed to advance new technologies. ” [78]. In fact, one recent\nanalysis found that the real GHG footprints of major tech com-\npany data centers can exceed reported values by over 600% [88]. In\nresponse, AI-driven technology firms are increasingly looking to\nnuclear energy as a lower-carbon alternative to fossil-fuel energy\ngeneration that can still provide 24/7 power to datacenters, both by\nre-commissioning existing infrastructure, such as the Three Mile\nIsland and Susquehanna nuclear power generation facilities in the\nU.S. state of Pennsylvania [25], and exploring future development\nof more modern small modular reactors (SMRs) [124]. In addition to\nthe regulatory and security challenges of increasing nuclear power\ngeneration capacity, nuclear power presents a distinct set of envi-\nronmental harms related to disposal of nuclear waste, and increased\nwater consumption required for cooling [92], as well as operational\nbottlenecks that complicate its widespread adoption [84].\nAI makes oil and gas extraction processes even more harmful to\nthe environment. AI technologies are currently extensively used\nin oil and gas exploration and drilling, significantly improving\nefficiency and increasing yield [110, 123]. These enabled emissions\nare difficult to quantify due to lack of corporate transparency and\nreporting, but they have been attracting scrutiny in recent years,\ngiven the environmental harm that they perpetuate. For instance, a\ncoalition of Microsoft employees estimated that a single deal the\ncompany struck with Exxon Mobil that uses AI to expand oil and\ngas production in Texas and New Mexico by 50,000 barrels of oil per\nday could add up to 640 percent more carbon emissions compared to\nthe company’s carbon removal targets for the year [119], yet these\nnumbers were not included in the company’s carbon accounting\nand reporting efforts [118]. Other firms have been equally opaque\nabout their AI-driven enabling of the oil and gas exploration, but\na Greenpeace report from 2020 ties all of the major technology\ncompanies to the sector [44].\nAI contributes to the ballooning issue of electronic waste. AI’s\nexpanding operational footprint also contributes to electronic waste\n(e-waste), which is now the fastest-growing segment of solid waste\nworldwide, reaching 62 million tonnes in 2022. Ongoing reports\nhave pointed to the urgent need to find ways to reduce the amount\nof waste and to reuse these materials more effectively given the\nstatus of e-waste as both an environmental and health hazard [98].\nThe UN’s Global E-Waste Monitor 2024 showed that about 22% of\ne-waste has been shown to be formally collected and recycled, with\nglobal generation of electronic waste rising five times faster than\ne-waste recycling [10]. The remainder ends up dumped in landfills,\noften in developing countries, where researchers assess both how\nhazardous substances like mercury, arsenic, and lead leach into\nlocal ecosystems and how they impact public health. High turnover\nin AI hardware is accelerating e-waste output: although GPUs can\ntheoretically last about five years, the push for higher performance\nis prompting more frequent upgrades – one recent study estimates\nthat AI will generate an additional 1.2–5 million metric tons of\ne-waste by 2030 [134].\n2.2 Arguments that AI is a net climate positive\nThe argument that AI will ultimately be more beneficial than harm-\nful to the environment is primarily based on the narrative that AI\ncan be sustainably developed and used for applications that directly\nbenefit the environment, or that could accelerate the technologi-\ncal advances needed to address climate change. However, claims\naround AI’s sustainability and significance in enabling new sci-\nentific advances remain largely hypothetical, with little explicit\nevidence or quantitative analysis of how the overall impact of AI\napplications, which may cause equal or greater harm to the en-\nvironment or even accelerate climate change, will be ultimately\nbeneficial. We discuss the main assertions supporting AI’s positive\nrole with respect to climate change in more detail below.\nAI applications can contribute to climate change mitigation and\nadaptation. The positive potential of AI for climate action has gen-\nerated considerable enthusiasm, and there are many existing and\nin-progress projects and initiatives that aim to harness this poten-\ntial into concrete tools and applications [99, 132]. There are several\nkey areas in which this is particularly salient, from generating\ninsights from large quantities of data in different modalities to op-\ntimizing complex systems and tools [21]. Concretely, this can be\nseen in applications of AI that analyze satellite imagery to iden-\ntify deforestation [133], methane leaks [102], or even the health of\ncoral reefs from space [16]. AI has also improved the accuracy of\nweather forecasts, which can help renewable energy grid operators\npredict the output of solar panels and wind turbines, which can\nhelp streamline the transition towards renewable energy sources\non a global scale [66, 107] In recent years, the development of AI\nfor accelerating scientific discovery in materials science has be-\ncome an area of focus, especially in applying generative AI models,\nwhich are able to assess or generate potential new compounds with\nclimate-positive applications such as renewable energy and carbon\ncapture [12, 76, 140]. Finally, the use of AI in solar geoengineer-\ning (i.e. injecting aerosol particles into the atmosphere to reflect\nsunlight and reduce global warming) has also gathered traction,\ngiven AI’s potential to help predict the impacts of geoengineering\non existing ecosystems and avoid possible negative side effects [3].\nAI’s negative climate impact is negated by carbon-free energy and\ncarbon offsets. AI-driven products and services are the primary\ncontributor to AI’s direct environmental impacts, and leading AI\ncompanies including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have\ncommitted to achieving net-zero carbon emissions for their busi-\nness operations, including AI development and use, within the\nnext 5-15 years [6, 42, 77, 78]. The primary mechanism by which\nthese companies plan to achieve their goal is by increasing the\nuse of renewable energy over that period, alongside compensat-\ning for emissions using market-based mechanisms such as power\npurchase agreements (PPAs), , long-term contracts between energy\nproviders and customers who promise to purchase a certain amount\nof generated energy over a decades-long horizon, carbon offsets,\nand investment in carbon-reducing technologies. The high-level\nidea behind these market-based mechanisms is that any carbon-\nproducing activity can be negated by an equally carbon-reducing\nactivity, resulting in net zero emissions globally. In the absence of\nsignificant advances in renewable energy production, storage and\n\nFAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Luccioni et al.\ndistribution (which, like other transformative changes in the climate\nspace, would also require significant investment in infrastructure\nand navigating corresponding sociopolitical systems), PPAs and\ncarbon offsets will remain necessary to fill the gap. However, off-\nsetting was only ever meant to serve as a temporary stop-gap to\nhelp reduce emissions in the short term, and does not represent\na viable replacement to reducing actual emissions. Fundamental\nlimitations to carbon offsetting are: (1) the difficulty of proving\nadditionality, or that the carbon-reducing activity would not have\nhappened regardless of investment or purchase of the offset [17, 46],\nand (2) that offsetting rarely mitigates localized impacts to the com-\nmunities where emissions or other environmental degradation is\noccurring. Increasingly, companies such as Intel and TSMC are\nreporting annual water withdrawal and consumption as well, and\ncompensating with market-based water offsets which are subject\nto the same challenges [138].\nIncreases in efficiency will negate growth in AI resource consump-\ntion. Another common viewpoint is that the direct environmental\nimpacts of AI will diminish over time due to increases in hardware,\nsoftware and algorithmic efficiency. Patterson et al. [90] argue that\n“the carbon footprint of machine learning training will plateau,\nthen shrink” thanks to continued innovations in machine learn-\ning models, specialized hardware platforms, data center efficiency,\nscheduling and use patterns, which will reduce overall energy use\nand emissions. The claim that increasing AI efficiency will lead to\nan overall reduction in AI’s resource use is a clear example of why\na deeper engagement with indirect effects is needed in the work\non AI and climate change.\nSimilarly to Jevons’ Paradox, just because an AI model becomes\nmore efficient, that does not imply that overall AI resource consump-\ntion will decrease, and in fact the inverse effect is highly plausible.\nHowever, as Koomey and Masanet [65] cogently argue, this is not\nthe first time the alarm has been raised about rising energy use due\nto technology, and that similar projections made in the dot-com\nboom of the early 2000s failed to materialize. They cite poor data\navailability, flawed methodology, and inaccurate reporting as causes\nfor inaccurate projections in data center energy use that ultimately\ndid not take into account significant improvements in data center\nefficiency. Similar uncertainty is clouding the prediction of AI’s\nenergy use, and we are well aligned with Koomey and Masanet[65],\nMasanet et al. [74] and others in calling for more granular trans-\nparent data from technology firms and service providers, and more\nrigorous analysis of available data. This does not imply, however,\nthat AI will necessarily follow the same trend as past technological\nadvances. Further, although data center energy use is a relatively\naccessible statistic for approximating the environmental impacts\nof ICT, it represents only small portion of the diverse direct and\nindirect negative environmental impacts arising from AI, which\nextend far beyond GHG emissions due to the energy required to\ndevelop and use AI models.\nThere is no reason to focus on AI over other technological advances\nor sectors. Some would argue that there is no reason to raise con-\ncerns around the current or future energy use (and corresponding\nenvironmental impacts) of AI specifically, as compared to any other\nway that energy might be used, such as “for watching television, mi-\ncrowaving popcorn, [or] powering lights” [18]. This line of thought\nposits that AI will be subject to the same market pressures, such\nas energy prices, as any other use case, and as a result will ben-\nefit from the same innovations, such as a market transitions to\nrenewable energy. This oversimplification ignores the reality that\n(1) AI is already responsible for non-trivial negative environmental\nexternalities and (2) we can, and likely should, regulate certain\nuses of AI as appropriate/inappropriate or necessary/unnecessary,\nand that this does require breaking down the monolith of “AI” into\ndifferent use cases and corresponding judgments of potential utility.\nFor example, under a limited energy or emissions budget, we might\nselectively incentivize uses of AI that contribute towards the UN’s\nsustainable development goals [130] or mitigate national security\nconcerns, over e.g. generating personalized ads for social media\n(as we discussion in Section 3). Finally, AI does differ substantially\nfrom other energy sinks in its potential to engender vast transfor-\nmations in the economy and society, similar to how the advent of\nthe Internet has undeniably changed the nature of work, education,\nand social interactions. Purely economic incentives have obviously\nfailed to align well with environmental sustainability in the past,\nand AI is no different; this does not mean that we should not strive\nto do better with this new technology.\nWhile debates over AI’s role in climate change and sustainability\nhave become increasingly polarized, both sides have tended to\nfocus only on the direct impacts of this technology— positive and\nnegative. But direct effects are not the whole story. As we show\nin the next section, the integration of AI into tools and systems\nreshapes social structures and influences human behavior, which\nultimately has complex environmental consequences.\n3 Indirect Impacts and Rebound Effects\nIn economics and lifecycle assessment, direct impacts, such as those\ndescribed in the previous section, are those engendered by the prod-\nuct during its lifecycle, whereas indirect (or second order) impacts\nrefer to systemic responses to the development of the product in\nterms of behavioral or structural changes which affect on other pro-\ncesses, structures and lifestyles [22, 97, 136]. Indirect impacts also\ninclude rebound effects, which occur when the improvement of one\naspect of a product results in unintended negative consequences\ndue to increased adoption, usage, and workloads [ 13]. These im-\npacts inevitably come with consequences to the environment due\nto the increased usage, or a redistribution in the usage, of natural\nresources. Given that AI pervades many different areas of society\nand economic sectors, it is more difficult to enumerate all of the\npossible indirect impacts and rebound effects that it can have, which\nwould involve considering the different interactions at play within\nevery sector and between them [23, 53]. Nonetheless, our aim in\nthis section is to propose a way of thinking about the indirect envi-\nronmental impacts of AI that can help inform discussions around\nAI’s environmental costs and benefits to make them more complete\nthan those described in Section 2. In Table 1, we take elements from\nthe qualitative taxonomy for second order environmental effects of\nICT proposed by Börjesson, Rivera et al. [97] as well as the initial\nwork on the indirect impacts of AI by Kaack et al. [63]. We build\nupon and adapt both of these approaches to get a better idea of the\ndifferent types of indirect environmental impacts of AI technolo-\ngies and, to the extent possible, propose approaches to track and\n\nFrom Efficiency Gains to Rebound Effects FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece\nmitigate them to ensure that given interventions do not exacerbate\nthe very things that they were meant to improve.\nWe further describe each type of effect below, organizing AI’s\nrebound effects into three themes: material objects and physical\nspaces (§3.1), micro- and macro-economic processes (§3.2), and\nsociety and human behavior (§3.3). We provide examples of each,\ndescribing the complex ways in which AI-enabled tools and services\nchange existing structures, with unintended ripple effects on the\nenvironment.\n3.1 Material Rebound Effects\nAI is impacting the distribution of objects and physical space by\nchanging the way products are made and distributed, and the func-\ntionalities that they need to have in order to allow us to interact\nwith AI tools and systems. This has material rebound effects across\ncomplex global supply chains, which inexorably changes the way\nnatural resources are exploited, transported, and combined.\nFor instance, substitution impacts arise when one product or\nservice replaces another, rendering digital something that was previ-\nously analog (i.e. dematerializing it). Recent examples of this include\nonline streaming which has replaced VHS cassettes, vinyl records,\nCDs and DVDs, as well as e-readers substituting print books and\nmagazines [48]. This can come with both positive and negative im-\npacts in terms of sustainability: Increased capacity and efficiency of\nnew technologies (e.g. many different movies and TV shows being\navailable on a single streaming platform) can be invalidated by the\nincreased materials needed to support the underlying infrastructure\nneeded to host and deliver these technologies [ 95]. For instance,\na life cycle assessment (LCA), which evaluates the environmental\nimpacts of an artifact arising throughout its existence (typically\nincluding disposal), has been performed comparing print books to\ne-readers, finding that 115 books would produce the same amount\nof CO2 as a single Amazon Kindle device [32, 103]. In the case of\nAI, many previously material tools and products are being substi-\ntuted by digital, AI-enabled systems, such as paper maps having\nbeen replaced by digital navigation for routine travel. Substitution\nimpacts may occur at varying speeds and may be more gradual. For\ninstance, only a fraction of illustrations such as photographs and\nartworks have, as of yet, been replaced by AI-generated images,\nand combinations of AI tools and analog dictionaries are used for\ntranslation and writing tasks. While these substitution impacts are\nlikely environmentally-positive (given that it is no longer necessary\nto manufacture the equipment and supplies needed to carry out\nthe original task), the environmental impacts of developing and de-\nploying these AI-enabled tools remains under-explored and direct\ncomparisons are seldom performed, or even possible using status\nquo data and methodology (see Section 3.4).\nAnother type of material rebound effect, referred to as the scale\neffect, occurs when large-scale production or usage of a product\nhas a lesser environmental impact, therefore reducing some of\nthe environmental impacts incurred. For instance, purchasing raw\nmaterials in bulk or wholesale lowers overall production costs for\nbusinesses, and manufacturing on a larger scale allows a more\nefficient use of products that would otherwise be wasted [ 139].\nScaling is a core part of AI research and practice, and the promise of\n“methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as\nthe available computation becomes very great” [121] has become\na core tenet in the field. This is often guided by so-called scaling\nlaws that predict the optimal model size and number of training\nsteps based on data availability, incentivizing the development and\ndeployment of increasingly large models as more data becomes\navailable [49]. At a more granular level, hardware optimizations\nsuch as parallelization, do in fact support these economies of scale;\ne.g. batched inference on a GPU scales sub-linearly in the number\nof examples, allowing multiple queries to be performed at once\nat only a marginally higher cost [109]. In fact, batching, caching\nand other optimization techniques are routinely used as a means\nto improve the scaling of AI, allowing more users to interact with\never more powerful technologies [ 93, 141]. However, it remains\nunclear to what extent this pursuit of bigger models requiring more\ncomputation is counteracted by optimization approaches that are\nused in parallel, and the consequences this might have on power\ngrids and supply chains worldwide.\nThese kinds of shifts in the way objects and processes operate\ncan, in turn, come with space rebound effects that change the\nway physical space is used with the introduction of a new prod-\nuct. For instance, new approaches such as e-commerce have mani-\nfested changes in the physical space occupied by brick-and-mortar\nstores and warehouses, resulting in smaller stores and bigger ware-\nhouses [127]. This, in turn, has impacts on supply chain dynamics,\nredistributing the environmental footprint of operations (e.g. heat-\ning and cooling), logistics and transportation [ 41]. Similarly, the\nproliferation of videoconferencing platforms and the increased ac-\ncessibility of high-speed internet, which facilitate remote work,\nalso comes with space rebound effects, with more people working\nfrom home, requiring home offices (and therefore bigger homes),\nand less need for dedicated office space in commercial buildings,\nwith further consequences in urban planning, mobility, and build-\ning maintenance [54]. Finally, the size of digital devices has been\nsteadily shrinking over the last decade. For instance, the average\nmass of a mobile phone shrank by half in the last decade [ 50],\nwhereas the average size of data centers has doubled [115]. With\nthe advent of user-facing AI tools and services running on shrink-\ning mobile devices, the configuration of data centers themselves\nhas shifted from a distributed network of smaller, in-house server\nrooms to warehouse-sized hyperscale data centers that have tens of\nthousands of servers in one place. These large, monolithic concen-\ntrations of servers enable the large-scale training of AI models, since\nit allows the high-speed interconnection of thousands of compute\nnodes serving as a single supercomputer [ 51]. While hyperscale\ndata centers typically achieve the highest efficiency (measured as\nPUE), their resource consumption intensity, further magnified by\ntheir exceptionally high geographic concentration [ 57], can put\nundue strain on local infrastructure. For example, Loudoun County\nin the U.S. State of Virginia has become known as “Data Center\nAlley, ” hosting 25 million square feet of data centers that use a\nquarter of the state’s energy and put extreme strain on its energy\nsupply [129].\n\nFAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Luccioni et al.\nIndirect Effect Examples for AI’s environmental impacts\nSubstitution impacts Art replaced by AI-generated imagery\nEncyclopedias and books replaced by AI-generated content\nSpace rebound effects Datacenters are getting bigger while devices are getting smaller\nScale effects AI models growing in size and complexity\nDirect economic rebound effects AI hardware getting more efficient, yet datacenter energy usage is rising\nIndirect economic rebound effects More consumer devices (speakers, appliances, etc.) that allow users\nto interact with AI systems\nEconomy-wide rebound effects Power purchase agreements from AI compute providers enable global\nrenewable energy capacity to be expanded\nInduction impacts Targeted ads that use AI to induce more consumption\nTime rebound effects AI-optimized navigation\nRobots doing household chores\nTable 1: Examples of AI’s indirect impacts and rebound effects, expanding on Börjesson Rivera et al [97].\n3.2 Economic Rebound Effects\nAs seen in Section 2, AI is increasingly integrated into economic\nsystems of profit and production, making existing tools more pow-\nerful and creating new ones. But these integrations can engender\nmacroeconomic ripple effects across the technology sector as well\nas adjacent ones, changing structures and processes, as well as\ntransforming whole industries.\nDirect economic rebound effects refer to situations in which\nthe improved efficiency of a product decreases its price, therefore\nleading to an increase in its consumption. In the centuries since the\nconcept of Jevons’ paradox was developed, similar rebound effects\nhave been observed with respect to energy [ 40] and water [ 33],\nas well as in domains such as road travel (where improvements\nto roads have been found to result in increased congestion [126])\nand agriculture (where increasing the yield of a crop makes it\nmore profitable to grow it, thereby increasing land use overall [11]).\nThey are also the most common type of indirect effects that are\ndiscussed in conjunction with many technological innovations (see\n[63, 135]). AI is no exception to direct economic rebound effects.\nWhile efficiency improvements are being made to the hardware\nused for training and deploying AI models [ 9, 82, 89], NVIDIA\nshipped 3.7 million GPUs in 2024 (more than a million more units\nthan in 2023) due to increased demand, despite these improvements\nin efficiency [105]. The data centers that host this hardware are\nalso becoming more efficient, with the average PUE (Power Usage\nEfficiency) dropping steadily in recent years [37, 106]; however, the\nenergy use and environmental impacts of these data centers has\nbeen rising (as described in Section 2).\nIndirect economic rebound effects are similar to the direct ef-\nfects described above, but instead of improved efficiency increasing\nthe usage of the same product, it affects a different product. This\nkind of rebound effect is also known as a real income effect because\nthe reduced price of one product means that consumers have more\nincome available to spend on other products and services [55]. For\ninstance, money saved from more fuel-efficient vehicles can be\nspent on air travel or consumer products [94, 112]. For AI, indirect\neconomic rebound effects can be observed for consumer electronics\nand “smart” devices such as speakers, microwaves and refrigera-\ntors. While the primary function of these devices is not AI-driven,\nthey can use AI to propose recipes, answer questions and curate\nplaylists. As more and more AI-enabled consumer tools are de-\nveloped, the pressure to upgrade existing devices to benefit from\nthese tools increases as well. However, these upgrades come with\na price in terms of the natural resources required to manufacture\nthem, as well as to process user data and respond to user queries in\nreal-time [58]. For example, when new functionalities are released\non smartphones, they often require purchasing the most recent\nversions of phones to use them, as was the case with the recent\nlaunch of Apple Intelligence, which runs only on the most recent\ngenerations of iPhones [7], as well as running most of its processing\nin the cloud, rather than on-device [34].\nOn a more macro level still, economy-wide rebound effects\noccur when an innovation provokes far-reaching changes in the\nproduction and use of other goods, producing flow-on effects in\nthe economy at large. For instance, improvements in global en-\nergy efficiency and fuel use have enabled the development of new\neconomies on a global scale, allowing the creation of new indus-\ntries [87]. These types of rebound effects can be particularly large\nfor so-called “general-purpose technologies” such as electricity, the\nsteam engine and the Internet, since these can have global spillover\neffects on industries and labor markets [111, 112]. Estimating the\nscope of economy-wide rebound effects has historically been dif-\nficult [117], especially for technologies [ 43]. One way in which\nAI is concretely impacting the economy at large is via PPAs, as\nmentioned in Section 2.2. In 2020, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and\nGoogle alone accounted for almost 30% of all PPAs purchased by\ncorporations worldwide [131], changing the scope and extent of the\nmechanism as a whole. Renewable energy PPAs mitigate the risk of\ninvestment in renewable energy infrastructure, thereby supporting\nits development [122]. Further, while a portion of the generated\nrenewable energy is transmitted to purchasers in practice, the re-\nmainder is added to the energy grid in that region, allowing other\nusers to benefit from its availability. It has also been proposed that\n\nFrom Efficiency Gains to Rebound Effects FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece\nfoundation models are general purpose technologies with corre-\nsponding potential for broad impacts to the economy and labor\nmarkets [35]. Analyzing the impact of these changes in the future\nwill be necessary to validate this claim (we discuss approaches to\ntracking AI’s indirect impacts in Section 3.4).\n3.3 Societal and Behavioral Rebound Effects\nAs users of technology and citizens of society, our behaviors are\nshaped and affected by the technologies we use. This has increas-\ningly become the case for AI as it becomes more intertwined in\ndaily activities such as shopping, travel, household chores, and\nthe workplace. In this section, we describe ways in which AI can\nimpact human behaviors and how those changes, can have broader\nenvironmental impacts in turn.\nInduction effects occur when the savings in resource consump-\ntion (e.g. energy or water) gained through improved efficiency are\nexceeded by the increased consumption and thereby production of\neither the materials or the final products. For instance, the advent of\nfast fashion and mass-produced furniture have reduced the quantity\nof natural resources, such as wood or cotton, needed to produce\na single piece of clothing or furniture. However, the amount of\nplastics, petrochemicals and waste that are engendered by the in-\ncreased accessibility of these items and therefore their increased\nconsumption are damaging to the environment [81]. In the case of\nAI, a prime example of this is targeted advertising, one of the most\nlucrative commercial applications of AI, with revenues reaching $36\nbillion in 2024 [116]. Advertising also constitutes the main source\nof revenue for many technology companies such as Google and\nMeta [85]; Amazon’s AI-powered product recommendation tool\ngenerates almost a third of its annual sales [73]. Although it is diffi-\ncult to obtain quantitative data on the impact of AI on e-commerce,\nthe details of which are largely considered sensitive trade secrets,\nthe corresponding machine learning approaches of recommenda-\ntion and ranking are active topics of research in the AI community,\npowered by an enormous quantity of user data being continuously\ngathered through interactions with digital platforms [ 19, 20, 31].\nThe rapid expansion of online advertising its direct and indirect\nenvironmental impacts have been emphasized in research papers\nand scientific reports over the last years [47, 91]. The contribution\nof AI to this expansion is worth considering when measuring the\nperformance of new algorithms and approaches [ 28], especially\ngiven the net-zero and emission reduction goals of many AI-driven\ncompanies whose revenue models depend on it [135].\nTime rebound effects occur when an innovation changes con-\nsumers’ use of their time, which then frees up (or removes) time\nfor other activities that they carry out. For example, if a vacuum\ncleaner reduces the time needed to clean the floors in a house, it\ncan free up time for leisure activities such as reading or sports. Mea-\nsuring the sustainability benefits of these time savings is far from\nstraightforward, because what we do with this newly-freed time\ncan have negative environmental impacts as well, e.g. if time other-\nwise spent doing chores is now spent shopping or traveling, this\ncan increase one’s overall carbon footprint [15]. AI is undeniably\nimpacting how time is spent at work and at home: many activities\nhave already been streamlined using AI over the last decade, such\nas AI-enabled navigation that avoids traffic congestion, automated\nlicense plate recognition and tolling on highways, and robotic vacu-\nums. Initial work on the environmental consequences of these shifts\nhas proposed that AI-enabled automation in household tasks and\nin the workplace actually leads to greater resource consumption\nand higher negative environmental impacts overall [36]. This con-\ntradicts research carried out on AI-assisted navigation specifically,\nwhich has been shown to reduce emissions by an average of 3.4%,\nbased on data gathered by Google on users of Google Maps [ 8].\nThis discrepancy highlights the difficulty of making far-reaching\nclaims regarding the sustainability impacts of a given innovation\nwithout considering the spillover effects and behavioral changes\nthat it may engender more broadly.\nIndirect policy effects. In addition to societal and behavioral\nforces, there are also indirect geopolitical and policy effects. Inter-\nnational policy interventions, particularly those aiming to bolster\nnational self-sufficiency from global supply chains, can provoke\nunintended increases in environmental burdens through mineral de-\nmand amplification, industrial deregulation, and competitive over-\nproduction. The dynamics of Koomey’s Law, by which the energy\nefficiency of computing has historically doubled approximately ev-\nery 1.57 years, can also be affected by geopolitical disputes and trade\nwars. If chip sales are restricted, for example, nations have to make\ndo with less powerful and less energy-efficient semiconductors.\nAs national strategies to monopolize or re-shore semiconductor\ncapacity develop, this can further accelerate national rivalries and\nresult in the replication of systems and further resource-intensive\nscaling of model training infrastructure. The United States CHIPS\nand Science Act (2022) is one example. This legislation aims to\nre-shore semiconductor fabrication. While its primary goal is to\nreduce dependency on Chinese manufacturing, it has the potential\nto intensify domestic resource demands. Semiconductor fabrication\nfacilities (known as fabs) impose massive environmental burdens,\nconsuming large quantities of energy, water and specialized chemi-\ncals while generating substantial carbon emissions (Villard, 2015).\nThe domestic expansion of fabs in the United States shifts rather\nthan reduces these environmental impacts, potentially introducing\nnew ecological pressures in regions with water scarcity issues like\nArizona, where several new facilities were planned. Meanwhile\nthe ongoing resource pressures continue in China and Taiwan.\nMoreover, the race to decouple US semiconductor supply chains\nfrom geopolitical adversaries has led to intensified extraction of\nrare-earth elements, lithium, cobalt, and high-purity quartz. This\ngeopolitical reorganization of material flows extends the environ-\nmental footprint of AI beyond traditional carbon accounting. China\nrestricting the export of several rare earth elements has meant that\nmines in Ukraine and Australia are already under expanded pres-\nsure to meet US demand. The increased competition for critical\nminerals has both social and ecological impacts, and risks even\ngreater environmental harms in conflict-affected regions.\nThese indirect policy effects risks are further compounded when\nenvironmental deregulation coincides with large-scale investment\nin AI-related infrastructure. The Trump administration in 2025\nhas been marked by a comprehensive rollback of environmental\nprotections, including a withdrawal from the Paris agreement, sig-\nnificantly altering the United States’ approach to climate and en-\nergy policy. Simultaneously, President Trump announced a $500\n\nFAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Luccioni et al.\nbillion USD investment in AI infrastructure known as Project Star-\ngate, which aims to significantly increase the number of very large\n(hyperscale) data centers and bypass environmental impact assess-\nments while offering public subsidies. These policy shifts can lock-\nin energy and environmental demands that outpace any computa-\ntional efficiency gains.\nThis decoupling of AI infrastructure from environmental respon-\nsibility illustrates a critical rebound mechanism: technical efficiency\nimprovements, such as high-efficiency datacenter designs or AI\nmodel efficiency optimizations, are insufficient when broader reg-\nulatory and policy conditions incentivize unchecked growth. By\nfacilitating rapid deployment without ecological constraint, these\nconditions create an emissions burden with resource demands that\nscale with model proliferation. In such contexts, even the best-case\nefficiency improvements under Koomey’s Law may be dwarfed by\nthe sheer increase in volume of compute infrastructure. Then the\nindirect effects of these policies on the environment are no longer\nmarginal, they become structural. The recent DeepSeek model is\nactually an interesting addition to the debate around efficiency and\nenergy because, on the one hand, it was trained using relatively less\nenergy and compute compared to previous generations of language\nmodels (due mostly to the export limitations on GPUs to China,\nwhich limited the amount of chips that was available for training\nit), but on the other hand, this was only possible by leveraging\nsynthetic data generated by these models. Also, the model itself is\nvery large –almost 700B parameters for the R1 model – meaning\nthat deploying it requires access to multiple GPUs with several hun-\ndreds of GB of memory, which is significantly more than smaller\nmodels of a smaller size, which can contribute to more energy use\noverall as organizations deploy the model in user-facing applica-\ntions. Finally, as detailed in the DeepSeek-R1-Zero report [29], the\nmodel requires much more inference-time computation and energy\nthan previous approaches due to its reasoning abilities. This results\nin the generation of much longer answers to queries detailing the\nsteps that the model is going through to provide the final response,\nwhich leads to more inference-time compute and energy demands.\n3.4 Tracking and Mitigating AI’s Rebound\nEffects\nThe main challenges in measuring and mitigating indirect impacts\nand rebound effects are their uncertainty and heterogeneity. While\ntracking direct impacts can largely be achieved by monitoring a\nfinite set of relatively well-defined metrics, such as liters of water\nconsumed or tons of CO2 emitted, rebound effects by definition en-\ncompass social, economic, and behavioral impacts across different\nareas of society [114]. Realizing effective progress in characterizing\nAI’s rebound effects necessitates moving beyond the binary narra-\ntive towards more holistic assessment that incorporates a variety of\ncomplementary approaches. We discuss some of these approaches\nbelow.\nQualitative and quantitative research. Starting with the material\nrebound effects of digital technologies such as AI, it can be tempting\nto make comparisons such as the research described in Section 3.1,\nwhich carry out LCA comparisons between e.g. a book and an e-\nreader. However, we are currently lacking sufficient methodology\nand data that would allow for meaningful comparison of the en-\nvironmental impacts of humans versus the same tasks performed\nby humans alone or assisted by AI. Initial work on this subject\nhas concluded that “AI systems emit between 130 and 1500 times\nless CO2e per page of text generated compared to human writers,\nwhile AI illustration systems emit between 310 and 2900 times\nless CO2e per image than their human counterparts, ” however, the\nauthors themselves note that their analyses “do not account for\nsocial impacts such as professional displacement, legality, and re-\nbound effects” [128]. More qualitative and multi-faceted analyses\nare needed, such as those that take into account aspects like the\nlength of time that content will actually be useful to readers and\nthe way in which the data was collected, can help shed light on\nthe issue, as well as more empirical research to study how human\nartists and writers use AI technologies and how that impacts the\nenvironment.\nTransparency. A key challenge to tracking AI’s economic re-\nbound effects stems from the severe scarcity of information regard-\ning the nature and extent of AI’s actual permeation throughout the\neconomy. The rapid integration of AI into many existing products\nand services, combined with vague and often broad definitions of\nAI, has made it difficult to disentangle AI-influenced growth from\ngrowth that might have occurred regardless. This challenge is in-\ntensified by the perception that details on corporate AI model use\nrepresent valuable intellectual property and trade secrets. Gath-\nering more information about specific AI deployment scenarios,\ni.e. which AI models are actually being deployed, in which sectors,\nwhat are they being used for in practice, and what are the impacts\nof those uses, will become increasingly important as AI becomes\nestablished as a mainstream technology. Connecting data on AI\nmodel resource consumption to corresponding positive or negative\nimpacts arising from those models is key to understanding trade-\noffs and informing decision-making. In the case of induction effects\nin particular, establishing baselines across industries, for instance\ndocumenting the environmental impacts of technologies currently\nin use, and measuring changes to those baselines as AI is integrated\nwould enable tracking longitudinal trends. Requiring companies\nusing AI in applications such as targeted advertising to indicate this\nusage, as well as what data was used to choose an ad for a specific\nproduct, can help users better understand why they are receiving\nads and contribute towards more mindful consumption [26, 79].\nRegulation. While focusing on efficiency alone has largely been\nsufficient in the past to curb the environmental impacts of rising\ncompute [75], given the astronomical rise in computational (and\ncorresponding energy and natural) resources needed to power AI\nservices resulting from generative AI, complementary efforts are\nneeded to address these impacts [108]. Historically, economic poli-\ncies that increase the cost of these resources have been shown to\nhelp control certain rebound effects [39]. Initiatives such as energy\nefficiency certifications (e.g. the U.S EPA’s Energy Star certifica-\ntion, Energy Labels in the EU) can also reduce resource use by\nincentivizing the sales and production of more efficient tools and\nsystems, successful for increasing energy efficiency for household\nappliances [27]. Related proposals have been introduced for AI mod-\nels [38, 71], although the lack of centralized authority for regulating\nAI (either at a national or international level) has made it difficult\n\nFrom Efficiency Gains to Rebound Effects FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece\nso far to operationalize such a proposal. Regulations could also\nserve an important role in mandating reporting of the necessary\ndata described above, e.g. requiring disclosure of the usage of AI\nfor environmentally harmful applications such as oil and gas ex-\nploration, which although highly relevant, is not typically reflected\nin corporate Environment and Sustainability Governance (ESG)\ndocuments.\nEfficient devices and distributed compute. Resource-efficient com-\nputing devices that require less natural resources (energy, water,\nraw materials) to build and use can be seen as an obvious gain in\nterms of environmental impacts, and different hardware platforms\nare being developed towards this end as an alternative to GPUs and\nCPUs, which represent the current status quo of AI computing hard-\nware [61, 62]. It is worth noting that there is typically a trade-off\nbetween resource efficiency and generality in terms of the compu-\ntational capabilities of the hardware: substantial efficiency gains\ntypically require the hardware to be correspondingly specialized to\ncertain types of computation, such as a specific family of AI models,\nwhich can accelerate indirect effects via lock-in, increasing depen-\ndence on a narrow set of vendors or products. New approaches\nto distributed and decentralized computation, in which AI model\nworkloads can be distributed across machines over wide distances\nrather than running within a single computing cluster or datacen-\nter, can also help distribute environmental burden geographically\nin terms of resource demand and local impacts. Examples include\nfully decentralized training [59] or redirecting training processes\ndepending on which cloud region has the lowest carbon intensity\nat a given time of day [30]. Above and beyond sustainability con-\nsiderations, adopting more flexible AI hardware and algorithms can\nhelp lower the barrier to entry into the field of AI and push back\nagainst industry monopolization of computational resources, and\ncorresponding power imbalance that this creates [1, 2].\n4 Discussion\nIn the context of climate change, artificial intelligence has emerged\nas a highly polarizing technology. On the one hand, it is champi-\noned as a driver of efficiency that could potentially invent new\nsolutions to the climate crisis or reinvent old ones [5, 21, 99]; on\nthe other hand, it is criticized for its steeply increasing resource\ndemands and carbon footprint [68, 120, 134]. This debate overlooks\na significant reality: we still do not have a comprehensive picture\nof AI’s current environmental impacts on everything from eco-\nnomic systems to individual behaviors. Consequently, the AI field\nrisks simplifying the nuances that must be understood if AI is to\nbe responsibly integrated into environmental policy and practice\nwithout exacerbating harms. A more accurate assessment of AI’s\nenvironmental outcomes would include a wider range of factors\nspanning data center operations, supply chains, hardware lifecy-\ncles, social behaviors, business incentives, policy commitments, and\ninstitutional practices.\nAs mentioned in Section 3, one under-explored dimension in\nthese debates involves the indirect or rebound effects that AI can\ngenerate. While much attention has been given to AI improving\nproductivity and resource efficiency, these gains can result in higher\noverall consumption due to effects such as Jevons Paradox. This\nparadox can manifest in several ways: for instance, an AI-driven\nlogistics system might reduce delivery times and fuel usage per\nvehicle, yet simultaneously encourage more frequent online orders,\nthus elevating total miles driven; AI-driven targeted advertising\ncan help us more easily find the products that we need based on\nour clicks and searches, but also push us to make more superflu-\nous purchases. Such systemic shifts in behavior challenge linear\nexpectations that efficiency improvements alone will drive down\nemissions. Instead, they underscore the need for a detailed, interdis-\nciplinary approach that links AI deployment to broader assessments\nof environmental, social, and economic feedback loops.\nApplying Jevons’ Paradox to technologies like AI has notable\nconceptual and empirical limitations due to the complexity inher-\nent in technological development and diffusion [101, 113]. While\nJevons’ Paradox anticipates increases in resource consumption fol-\nlowing efficiency improvements, its explanatory power diminishes\nwithin the broader systemic contexts of widespread AI diffusion.\nSorrell [2008] critiques Jevons’ paradox for oversimplifying complex\ncausal relationships among efficiency gains, economic expansion,\nand individual behavioral responses. This is particularly relevant\ngiven AI systems have many interdependencies across diverse eco-\nnomic sectors. Addressing these multifaceted rebound effects re-\nquires shifting from simplistic causal assumptions toward more\nintegrated sociotechnical analyses that can include a range of ap-\nproaches, from detailed empirical studies of technology adoption,\nuser behavior, policy factors, and evolving market dynamics. That\nwould also suggest that truly effective policy responses for AI sus-\ntainability would need to combine technological efficiency with\ninstitutional reforms and incentive structures specifically designed\nto decouple model development from unsustainable resource con-\nsumption. This approach would not only recognize the conditional\nvalidity of Jevons’ Paradox but actively embed sustainability within\nAI development.\nAlthough the research community has taken initial steps toward\nquantifying AI’s carbon footprint and water usage, these efforts\noften focus on direct resource consumption during model training\nand inference. While such measurements are essential, they are\nonly a partial view. Global supply chains—encompassing the extrac-\ntion of raw materials, the manufacturing of semiconductor chips,\nand the disposal of electronic waste—also contribute substantially\nto AI’s environmental cost, yet these distributed impacts remain\nnotoriously difficult to track [24, 83]. Companies and researchers\ncommonly disclose only a narrow range of environmental met-\nrics. This lack of standardized reporting impedes a full lifecycle\nassessment and perpetuates an environment in which the indirect\nburdens of AI remain opaque [72].\nAnother critical factor is the current market-driven context\nin which AI operates. At present, the most prominent AI break-\nthroughs, particularly large language models, function within an\neconomic system that rewards rapid growth and ever-increasing\ncomputational power [4, 125]. The result is that changing AI de-\nvelopment to align with the climate agenda is only possible if it\nsupports extant business incentives—or at least does not limit them.\nProposals that transcend profit-driven imperatives, such as limit-\ning the scale of AI (so-called “digital degrowth” [104]) or policy\nmechanisms such as a carbon tax on data center usage, remain\non the fringes of the field. Similarly, few stakeholders are calling\nfor enforced accountability on AI companies to internalize the\n\nFAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Luccioni et al.\ncosts of the environmental damage they cause, including resource\ndepletion, substantial energy consumption, or contributions to e-\nwaste streams. As a result, many of the purported “solutions” to\nclimate challenges via AI remain tethered to profit-driven impera-\ntives rather than broader systemic transformations. This structural\nconstraint significantly narrows the scope of AI’s potential as a\nclimate intervention, often leaving only those applications that\npromise quick returns or minimal disruptions to existing market\nlogics.\nThis reality highlights a structural barrier: if AI solutions to cli-\nmate change do not yield near-term financial returns, they may\nstruggle to gain traction in an industry propelled by venture capital,\nquarterly earnings, and shareholder expectations. Consequently,\nmany of the touted climate positive AI applications, like energy grid\noptimization or automated water management, risk being overshad-\nowed by more lucrative pursuits that do not necessarily mitigate\nenvironmental harm. The underlying problem, then, is not just\none of measuring or quantifying impacts more thoroughly within\nexisting market logics — this simply perpetuates Jevons’ paradox.\nInstead, what is required is a more substantial reimagining of the\nrelationship between AI technologies, business objectives, and eco-\nlogical imperatives [100]. Genuinely climate-aligned AI strategies\nmight require public policy frameworks that penalize unsustainable\npractices and reward genuinely carbon-negative deployments of\nAI, and business models that do not hinge on perpetual growth, in\norder to ensure that increased AI efficiency does not simply spur\nmore consumption.\nYet, as mentioned in Section 3.4, for any of these steps toward\nmeaningful change to materialize, the industry must adopt a far\nmore transparent stance on all the environmental impacts of AI\nsystems and take accountability for the far-reaching impacts of the\ntechnologies that it develops and deploys. At present, the scant\npublic information on the carbon footprint of large-scale AI models\nis frequently derived from academic estimates or limited corporate\ndisclosures rather than comprehensive, standardized reporting. If\nAI companies truly want to position their technologies as part of\nthe climate solution, they must be forthcoming with granular data\non their energy sources, resource consumption, hardware lifecycles,\nand the end-of-life management of electronic components. In other\nwords, the foundation of any net-positive AI contribution to the\nenvironment is a baseline of reliable, detailed data, which has yet to\nbe made widely available. Without this level of transparency, poli-\ncymaking bodies, researchers, and the public at large are left with\npartial insights at best, which undermines the capacity to assess\nAI’s environmental impacts effectively, to design incentives that\nreward lower-impact AI development, and for individuals to make\ninformed choices with respect to their use of these technologies.\nUltimately, the AI field is responsible for knowing the impacts of\nits own products, and it cannot do so without better data. This in-\nformation is crucial for performing accurate lifecycle assessments\nthat capture both direct and indirect consequences. Absent such\ndata, the conversation around AI’s climate benefits risks devolving\ninto corporate branding exercises rather than a genuine reckoning\nwith environmental and social responsibilities.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper argues that the AI field needs to adopt a more detailed\nand nuanced approach to framing, articulating, and addressing AI’s\nenvironmental impacts in order to avoid unhelpful polarization.\nThis requires including AI’s direct impacts—mineral supply chain\nstudies, carbon emissions of training large-scale models, energy\nand water consumption, and e-waste from hardware—as well as\nmapping the ways AI innovations reshape economic structures and\nsocietal practices that, in turn, drive increased resource usage. Such\na comprehensive perspective will empower researchers, policymak-\ners, and industry stakeholders to devise strategies that prevent\n“tech-solutionism” from overshadowing the urgent need for sys-\ntemic change. Greater transparency in reporting energy usage, more\nrobust lifecycle assessment tools, and meaningful industry-wide\nenforceable standards are examples that would foster much-needed\nprogress.\nUltimately, what is at stake is clear: There is a scientific consen-\nsus that the dangers of climate change are extreme, and the effects\nare already unfolding globally. The need to limit global warming to\nbelow 1.5°C underscores the need for transformative change across\nsectors, and the technology sector is no exception. If AI is deployed\nwithout adequate consideration of its direct and indirect effects, it\nhas the potential to deepen inequalities, accelerate resource deple-\ntion, and exacerbate the very climate problems it hopes to address.\nConversely, if approached with rigorous assessment, transparent\nreporting, and supportive policy frameworks, AI could serve as a\nhelpful tool in climate adaptation, environmental monitoring, and\nsustainable planning. Yet we cannot simply hope for the best out-\ncome. The onus is on the AI industry to ensure technology does not\ncontribute to the problem before producing any future solutions.\nThis requires reckoning with AI’s actual impacts, both direct and\nindirect, measured comprehensively and contextualized socially,\neconomically, and environmentally.\n\nFrom Efficiency Gains to Rebound Effects FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece\nReferences\n[1] Mohamed Abdalla and Moustafa Abdalla. 2021.

Some maintain that its\npotential to accelerate sustainable breakthroughs will exceed its en-\nvironmental costs by increasing renewable energy production and\ntransmission or aiding in the design of more sustainable materials\n[76, 99]. Others point to the soaring resource demands of large-\nscale AI models and their negative environmental impacts from\nnon-renewable energy use, water consumption, and extraction of\nminerals [24, 28, 45, 57]. These opposing positions tend to center on\nthe technology’s direct impacts, measured in energy consumption\nand greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from data centers, or in the\ne-waste that accumulates as hardware becomes obsolete.\nYet a critical dimension of AI’s climate footprint lies outside these\ndirect resource and emissions calculations. Recent work on indirect\nimpacts [63] warns of potential “rebound effects”, whereby gains in\nefficiency spur higher overall consumption. These second-order ef-\nfects challenge the presumption that purely technical optimizations\nalone will deliver sufficient climate benefits. Cost savings achieved\nby more efficient AI hardware, for example, can spur increased\ndemand for new AI functionalities, which in turn drive further\nhardware upgrades and increase costs. Economists refer to such\ntransformations as Jevons’ Paradox, which was proposed in the\n19th century by economist William Stanley Jevons, who observed\nthat as coal use became more efficient, it was also paradoxically\nleading to an increase, and not a decrease, in the consumption of\ncoal across different industries [60]. The addition of increasingly\nefficient AI to systems from commerce to transportation can have\nfar-reaching effects on our societies, our behaviors, and the future\npaths available to us in the race against climate change.\nThis system-level complexity underscores the inadequacy of the\nquestion, “Is AI net positive or net negative for the climate?” In-\nstead, we adopt an analytic approach that includes the intersecting\nsocial, political, and economic contexts in which AI systems are\ndeveloped and deployed. Although efficiency has been a defining\nethos in recent AI research, reflected in “scaling laws” that promise\never-more-powerful models [64], effective climate action requires\ngrappling with how these systems reshape markets, cultural norms,\nand policy priorities. Thus, understanding rebound effects requires\ndrawing on both qualitative and quantitative methods, drawn from\ncomputer science, economics and the social sciences, as they hinge\nnot on algorithmic design but human adaptation and use patterns.\nAdopting an interdisciplinary approach allows for both a rigorous\nlifecycle accounting of direct effects as well as understanding the\nsocial behaviors that AI can induce or displace.\nThis paper aims to bridge the gap in the existing literature by,\nfirst, providing a brief overview of the debate about AI’s direct pos-\nitive and negative impacts on the environment (§2).

By ex-\npanding this dialogue and grounding it in evidence across multiple\ndisciplines, we can develop strategies that genuinely address AI’s\nrole in environmental sustainability.\n2 AI and the environment\nThe environmental impacts of AI were largely overlooked until\nrecent years. Now these issues figure prominently in both scientific\ndebates and public media. Central to this discourse is the question\nof whether AI’s capacity to help mitigate climate change, e.g. by\noptimizing energy use or discovering sustainable materials, truly\nexceeds its environmental costs in terms of energy consumption,\nwater usage, and mineral extraction. Some contend that AI’s poten-\ntial benefits justify widespread deployment across various climate-\nfocused applications, whereas others caution that unrestrained\nexpansion may ultimately be more harmful than beneficial. In this\nsection, we review these competing perspectives on AI’s positive\nand negative environmental impacts as presented in academic and\nindustry discussions.\n2.1 Arguments that AI is a net climate negative\nResearch into AI’s total usage of natural resources is still nascent,\nbut initial studies have highlighted significant concerns across mul-\ntiple domains of direct impact. Papers have addressed carbon emis-\nsions from training large models [67, 69, 70, 120], water consump-\ntion for cooling servers [ 52, 80], and the mining of minerals for\ntechnical infrastructure [ 24]. In the present section, we present\nthe different directions of study pursued in terms of AI’s negative\nenvironmental impacts and discuss the observations that have been\nput forward.\nAI is using increasing amounts of energy, most of it generated from\nnonrenewable sources. Data from the International Energy Agency\n(IEA) has provided the strongest international benchmark. They\nnote that the electricity demand from data centers, driven heavily by\nAI training and inference, is currently at 2% of total global electricity\nand will more than double by 2026, surpassing Canada’s national\npower use [45, 56]. This growth is putting strain on energy grids\naround the world and resulting in many countries, such as Ireland\nand the Netherlands, placing a moratorium on the construction of\nnew data centers in certain regions. In the United States, the demand\nfor electricity has surged in the past twelve months – according to\na recent report into the national grid, electric utilities have nearly\ndoubled their forecasts of how much additional power they will\nneed in the next five years [137].\nAI data centers are putting stress on already strained aquifers glob-\nally. The construction and operation of data centers requires vast\nquantities of water, which is used for cooling servers to prevent\nthem from overheating by circulating cool water through radiators.\nThis cooling process requires a constant supply of cool, fresh water,\nwhich is heated up during the process, causing a significant portion\nof it to evaporate, whereas the rest has to be cooled and filtered\nbefore being reused or discharged back into local aquifers [ 96].\nCorporate reports have revealed the scale of water demand in-\ncreases, with Microsoft reporting a 34% increase in global water\nconsumption between 2021 and 2022, topping 1.7 billion gallons,\nwhile Google observed a 20% uptick in the same period [ 42, 78].\nOther studies have sought to estimate water usage at the level of\nindividual AI models, with one paper suggesting that 10–50 queries\non GPT-3 consumes around half a liter of water [68]. By 2050, 50%\nof the world’s population is projected to live in a region affected by\nwater scarcity [14], but the full impacts of data center water usage\nis unknown as “the entire data centre industry suffers from a lack\nof transparency” [80].\nThe rare earth minerals needed to produce computing hardware\nare mined in unsustainable and opaque ways. Metals such as cobalt,\nlithium, coltan, gallium, copper, tungsten, and germanium are re-\nquired for AI hardware and infrastructure. Individual studies have\nlooked at the impacts of mining lithium cobalt, copper, and rare\nearth for consumer devices (smartphones, tablets) to the GPUs and\nTPUs powering large-scale AI model training and addressed the\nresulting environmental damage and impact on local conflict and\nwar. One study specifically addressed mining on indigenous lands,\nwith 54% of technology-critical materials drawn from what they\ndescribe as Indigenous or peasant territory, while 62% were ex-\ntracted from drought-prone zones [86]. The mining of these metals\nalso comes with a cost to the environment, given the tonnes of\nearth that have to be mined, the radiation produced, and the toxic\nwaste created [28]. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Com-\npany (TSMC), the company that manufactures the GPUs designed\nby NVIDIA (among other companies), citing the complexity of their\nsupply chains and proprietary information of its customers, also\ndoes not provide granular data for their suppliers nor their internal\nprocesses (such as chemical purification) [136], meaning that it is\nimpossible to carry out a full life cycle analysis of the hundreds of\nthousands of GPUs that are designed and manufactured each year\nand used to train and deploy AI models.\nAI is responsible for a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-\nsions. Despite significant efforts by AI-driven companies to invest\nin renewable energy and meet net-zero emissions pledges, all ev-\nidence indicates that direct GHG emissions due to AI are on the\nrise. Many AI companies are reporting significantly higher GHG\nemissions over earlier baselines, likely driven by increases in de-\nvelopment and use of generative AI. For example, in their 2024\nannual environmental sustainability report (ESG), Google reports\na 48% increase in GHG emissions since 2019 which they attribute\nprimarily to “increases in data center energy consumption” [42],\nBaidu reports 32.6% increase in GHG emissions over 2021 citing\n“rapid development of LLMs” posing “severe challenges” to their\ndevelopment of green data centers [9], and Microsoft cites a 29.1%", "sentences": [{"text": "FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Luccioni et al.", "metadata": {}}, {"text": "with an in-depth exploration of AI’s indirect impacts,

We discuss the main assertions supporting AI’s positive\nrole with respect to climate change in more detail below.\nAI applications can contribute to climate change mitigation and\nadaptation. The positive potential of AI for climate action has gen-\nerated considerable enthusiasm, and there are many existing and\nin-progress projects and initiatives that aim to harness this poten-\ntial into concrete tools and applications [99, 132]. There are several\nkey areas in which this is particularly salient, from generating\ninsights from large quantities of data in different modalities to op-\ntimizing complex systems and tools [21]. Concretely, this can be\nseen in applications of AI that analyze satellite imagery to iden-\ntify deforestation [133], methane leaks [102], or even the health of\ncoral reefs from space [16]. AI has also improved the accuracy of\nweather forecasts, which can help renewable energy grid operators\npredict the output of solar panels and wind turbines, which can\nhelp streamline the transition towards renewable energy sources\non a global scale [66, 107] In recent years, the development of AI\nfor accelerating scientific discovery in materials science has be-\ncome an area of focus, especially in applying generative AI models,\nwhich are able to assess or generate potential new compounds with\nclimate-positive applications such as renewable energy and carbon\ncapture [12, 76, 140]. Finally, the use of AI in solar geoengineer-\ning (i.e. injecting aerosol particles into the atmosphere to reflect\nsunlight and reduce global warming) has also gathered traction,\ngiven AI’s potential to help predict the impacts of geoengineering\non existing ecosystems and avoid possible negative side effects [3].\nAI’s negative climate impact is negated by carbon-free energy and\ncarbon offsets. AI-driven products and services are the primary\ncontributor to AI’s direct environmental impacts, and leading AI\ncompanies including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have\ncommitted to achieving net-zero carbon emissions for their busi-\nness operations, including AI development and use, within the\nnext 5-15 years [6, 42, 77, 78]. The primary mechanism by which\nthese companies plan to achieve their goal is by increasing the\nuse of renewable energy over that period, alongside compensat-\ning for emissions using market-based mechanisms such as power\npurchase agreements (PPAs), , long-term contracts between energy\nproviders and customers who promise to purchase a certain amount\nof generated energy over a decades-long horizon, carbon offsets,\nand investment in carbon-reducing technologies.

However, off-\nsetting was only ever meant to serve as a temporary stop-gap to\nhelp reduce emissions in the short term, and does not represent\na viable replacement to reducing actual emissions. Fundamental\nlimitations to carbon offsetting are: (1) the difficulty of proving\nadditionality, or that the carbon-reducing activity would not have\nhappened regardless of investment or purchase of the offset [17, 46],\nand (2) that offsetting rarely mitigates localized impacts to the com-\nmunities where emissions or other environmental degradation is\noccurring. Increasingly, companies such as Intel and TSMC are\nreporting annual water withdrawal and consumption as well, and\ncompensating with market-based water offsets which are subject\nto the same challenges [138].\nIncreases in efficiency will negate growth in AI resource consump-\ntion. Another common viewpoint is that the direct environmental\nimpacts of AI will diminish over time due to increases in hardware,\nsoftware and algorithmic efficiency. Patterson et al. [90] argue that\n“the carbon footprint of machine learning training will plateau,\nthen shrink” thanks to continued innovations in machine learn-\ning models, specialized hardware platforms, data center efficiency,\nscheduling and use patterns, which will reduce overall energy use\nand emissions. The claim that increasing AI efficiency will lead to\nan overall reduction in AI’s resource use is a clear example of why\na deeper engagement with indirect effects is needed in the work\non AI and climate change.\nSimilarly to Jevons’ Paradox, just because an AI model becomes\nmore efficient, that does not imply that overall AI resource consump-\ntion will decrease, and in fact the inverse effect is highly plausible.\nHowever, as Koomey and Masanet [65] cogently argue, this is not\nthe first time the alarm has been raised about rising energy use due\nto technology, and that similar projections made in the dot-com\nboom of the early 2000s failed to materialize. They cite poor data\navailability, flawed methodology, and inaccurate reporting as causes\nfor inaccurate projections in data center energy use that ultimately\ndid not take into account significant improvements in data center\nefficiency. Similar uncertainty is clouding the prediction of AI’s\nenergy use, and we are well aligned with Koomey and Masanet[65],\nMasanet et al. [74] and others in calling for more granular trans-\nparent data from technology firms and service providers, and more\nrigorous analysis of available data. This does not imply, however,\nthat AI will necessarily follow the same trend as past technological\nadvances. Further, although data center energy use is a relatively\naccessible statistic for approximating the environmental impacts\nof ICT, it represents only small portion of the diverse direct and\nindirect negative environmental impacts arising from AI, which\nextend far beyond GHG emissions due to the energy required to\ndevelop and use AI models.\nThere is no reason to focus on AI over other technological advances\nor sectors. Some would argue that there is no reason to raise con-\ncerns around the current or future energy use (and corresponding\nenvironmental impacts) of AI specifically, as compared to any other\nway that energy might be used, such as “for watching television, mi-\ncrowaving popcorn, [or] powering lights” [18]. This line of thought\nposits that AI will be subject to the same market pressures, such\nas energy prices, as any other use case, and as a result will ben-\nefit from the same innovations, such as a market transitions to\nrenewable energy. This oversimplification ignores the reality that\n(1) AI is already responsible for non-trivial negative environmental\nexternalities and (2) we can, and likely should, regulate certain\nuses of AI as appropriate/inappropriate or necessary/unnecessary,\nand that this does require breaking down the monolith of “AI” into\ndifferent use cases and corresponding judgments of potential utility.\nFor example, under a limited energy or emissions budget, we might\nselectively incentivize uses of AI that contribute towards the UN’s\nsustainable development goals [130] or mitigate national security\nconcerns, over e.g. generating personalized ads for social media\n(as we discussion in Section 3). Finally, AI does differ substantially\nfrom other energy sinks in its potential to engender vast transfor-\nmations in the economy and society, similar to how the advent of\nthe Internet has undeniably changed the nature of work, education,\nand social interactions. Purely economic incentives have obviously\nfailed to align well with environmental sustainability in the past,\nand AI is no different; this does not mean that we should not strive\nto do better with this new technology.\nWhile debates over AI’s role in climate change and sustainability\nhave become increasingly polarized, both sides have tended to\nfocus only on the direct impacts of this technology— positive and\nnegative. But direct effects are not the whole story. As we show\nin the next section, the integration of AI into tools and systems\nreshapes social structures and influences human behavior, which\nultimately has complex environmental consequences.\n3 Indirect Impacts and Rebound Effects\nIn economics and lifecycle assessment, direct impacts, such as those\ndescribed in the previous section, are those engendered by the prod-\nuct during its lifecycle, whereas indirect (or second order) impacts\nrefer to systemic responses to the development of the product in\nterms of behavioral or structural changes which affect on other pro-\ncesses, structures and lifestyles [22, 97, 136]. Indirect impacts also\ninclude rebound effects, which occur when the improvement of one\naspect of a product results in unintended negative consequences\ndue to increased adoption, usage, and workloads [ 13]. These im-\npacts inevitably come with consequences to the environment due\nto the increased usage, or a redistribution in the usage, of natural\nresources. Given that AI pervades many different areas of society\nand economic sectors, it is more difficult to enumerate all of the\npossible indirect impacts and rebound effects that it can have, which\nwould involve considering the different interactions at play within\nevery sector and between them [23, 53]. Nonetheless, our aim in\nthis section is to propose a way of thinking about the indirect envi-\nronmental impacts of AI that can help inform discussions around\nAI’s environmental costs and benefits to make them more complete\nthan those described in Section 2. In Table 1, we take elements from\nthe qualitative taxonomy for second order environmental effects of\nICT proposed by Börjesson, Rivera et al. [97] as well as the initial\nwork on the indirect impacts of AI by Kaack et al. [63]. We build\nupon and adapt both of these approaches to get a better idea of the\ndifferent types of indirect environmental impacts of AI technolo-\ngies and, to the extent possible, propose approaches

organizing AI’s\nrebound effects into three themes: material objects and physical\nspaces (§3.1), micro- and macro-economic processes (§3.2), and\nsociety and human behavior (§3.3). We provide examples of each,\ndescribing the complex ways in which AI-enabled tools and services\nchange existing structures, with unintended ripple effects on the\nenvironment.\n3.1 Material Rebound Effects\nAI is impacting the distribution of objects and physical space by\nchanging the way products are made and distributed, and the func-\ntionalities that they need to have in order to allow us to interact\nwith AI tools and systems. This has material rebound effects across\ncomplex global supply chains, which inexorably changes the way\nnatural resources are exploited, transported, and combined.\nFor instance, substitution impacts arise when one product or\nservice replaces another, rendering digital something that was previ-\nously analog (i.e. dematerializing it). Recent examples of this include\nonline streaming which has replaced VHS cassettes, vinyl records,\nCDs and DVDs, as well as e-readers substituting print books and\nmagazines [48]. This can come with both positive and negative im-\npacts in terms of sustainability: Increased capacity and efficiency of\nnew technologies (e.g. many different movies and TV shows being\navailable on a single streaming platform) can be invalidated by the\nincreased materials needed to support the underlying infrastructure\nneeded to host and deliver these technologies [ 95]. For instance,\na life cycle assessment (LCA), which evaluates the environmental\nimpacts of an artifact arising throughout its existence (typically\nincluding disposal), has been performed comparing print books to\ne-readers, finding that 115 books would produce the same amount\nof CO2 as a single Amazon Kindle device [32, 103]. In the case of\nAI, many previously material tools and products are being substi-\ntuted by digital, AI-enabled systems, such as paper maps having\nbeen replaced by digital navigation for routine travel. Substitution\nimpacts may occur at varying speeds and may be more gradual. For\ninstance, only a fraction of illustrations such as photographs and\nartworks have, as of yet, been replaced by AI-generated images,\nand combinations of AI tools and analog dictionaries are used for\ntranslation and writing tasks. While these substitution impacts are\nlikely environmentally-positive (given that it is no longer necessary\nto manufacture the equipment and supplies needed to carry out\nthe original task), the environmental impacts of developing and de-\nploying these AI-enabled tools remains under-explored and direct\ncomparisons are seldom performed, or even possible using status\nquo data and methodology (see Section 3.4).\nAnother type of material rebound effect, referred to as the scale\neffect, occurs when large-scale production or usage of a product\nhas a lesser environmental impact, therefore reducing some of\nthe environmental impacts incurred. For instance, purchasing raw\nmaterials in bulk or wholesale lowers overall production costs for\nbusinesses, and manufacturing on a larger scale allows a more\nefficient use of products that would otherwise be wasted [ 139].\nScaling is a core part of AI research and practice, and the promise of\n“methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as\nthe available computation becomes very great” [121] has become\na core tenet in the field. This is often guided by so-called scaling\nlaws that predict the optimal model size and number of training\nsteps based on data availability, incentivizing the development and\ndeployment of increasingly large models as more data becomes\navailable [49]. At a more granular level, hardware optimizations\nsuch as parallelization, do in fact support these economies of scale;\ne.g. batched inference on a GPU scales sub-linearly in the number\nof examples, allowing multiple queries to be performed at once\nat only a marginally higher cost [109]. In fact, batching, caching\nand other optimization techniques are routinely used as a means\nto improve the scaling of AI, allowing more users to interact with\never more powerful technologies [ 93, 141]. However, it remains\nunclear to what extent this pursuit of bigger models requiring more\ncomputation is counteracted by optimization approaches that are\nused in parallel, and the consequences this might have on power\ngrids and supply chains worldwide.\nThese kinds of shifts in the way objects and processes operate\ncan, in turn, come with space rebound effects that change the\nway physical space is used with the introduction of a new prod-\nuct. For instance, new approaches such as e-commerce have mani-\nfested changes in the physical space occupied by brick-and-mortar\nstores and warehouses, resulting in smaller stores and bigger ware-\nhouses [127]. This, in turn, has impacts on supply chain dynamics,\nredistributing the environmental footprint of operations (e.g. heat-\ning and cooling), logistics and transportation [ 41]. Similarly, the\nproliferation of videoconferencing platforms and the increased ac-\ncessibility of high-speed internet, which facilitate remote work,\nalso comes with space rebound effects, with more people working\nfrom home, requiring home offices (and therefore bigger homes),\nand less need for dedicated office space in commercial buildings,\nwith further consequences in urban planning, mobility, and build-\ning maintenance [54]. Finally, the size of digital devices has been\nsteadily shrinking over the last decade. For instance, the average\nmass of a mobile phone shrank by half in the last decade [ 50],\nwhereas the average size of data centers has doubled [115]. With\nthe advent of user-facing AI tools and services running on shrink-\ning mobile devices, the configuration of data centers themselves\nhas shifted from a distributed network of smaller, in-house server\nrooms to warehouse-sized hyperscale data centers that have tens of\nthousands of servers in one place. These large, monolithic concen-\ntrations of servers enable the large-scale training of AI models, since\nit allows the high-speed interconnection of thousands of compute\nnodes serving as a single supercomputer [ 51]. While hyperscale\ndata centers typically achieve the highest efficiency (measured as\nPUE), their resource consumption intensity, further magnified by\ntheir exceptionally high geographic concentration [ 57], can put\nundue strain on local infrastructure. For example, Loudoun County\nin the U.S. State of Virginia has become known as “Data Center\nAlley, ” hosting 25 million square feet of data centers that use a\nquarter of the state’s energy and put extreme strain on its energy\nsupply [129].", "sentences": [{"text": "From Efficiency Gains to Rebound Effects FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece\nmitigate them to ensure that given

in Section 2, AI is increasingly integrated into economic\nsystems of profit and production, making existing tools more pow-\nerful and creating new ones. But these integrations can engender\nmacroeconomic ripple effects across the technology sector as well\nas adjacent ones, changing structures and processes, as well as\ntransforming whole industries.\nDirect economic rebound effects refer to situations in which\nthe improved efficiency of a product decreases its price, therefore\nleading to an increase in its consumption. In the centuries since the\nconcept of Jevons’ paradox was developed, similar rebound effects\nhave been observed with respect to energy [ 40] and water [ 33],\nas well as in domains such as road travel (where improvements\nto roads have been found to result in increased congestion [126])\nand agriculture (where increasing the yield of a crop makes it\nmore profitable to grow it, thereby increasing land use overall [11]).\nThey are also the most common type of indirect effects that are\ndiscussed in conjunction with many technological innovations (see\n[63, 135]). AI is no exception to direct economic rebound effects.\nWhile efficiency improvements are being made to the hardware\nused for training and deploying AI models [ 9, 82, 89], NVIDIA\nshipped 3.7 million GPUs in 2024 (more than a million more units\nthan in 2023) due to increased demand, despite these improvements\nin efficiency [105]. The data centers that host this hardware are\nalso becoming more efficient, with the average PUE (Power Usage\nEfficiency) dropping steadily in recent years [37, 106]; however, the\nenergy use and environmental impacts of these data centers has\nbeen rising (as described in Section 2).\nIndirect economic rebound effects are similar to the direct ef-\nfects described above, but instead of improved efficiency increasing\nthe usage of the same product, it affects a different product. This\nkind of rebound effect is also known as a real income effect because\nthe reduced price of one product means that consumers have more\nincome available to spend on other products and services [55]. For\ninstance, money saved from more fuel-efficient vehicles can be\nspent on air travel or consumer products [94, 112]. For AI, indirect\neconomic rebound effects can be observed for consumer electronics\nand “smart” devices such as speakers, microwaves and refrigera-\ntors. While the primary function of these devices is not AI-driven,\nthey can use AI to propose recipes, answer questions and curate\nplaylists. As more and more AI-enabled consumer tools are de-\nveloped, the pressure to upgrade existing devices to benefit from\nthese tools increases as well. However, these upgrades come with\na price in terms of the natural resources required to manufacture\nthem, as well as to process user data and respond to user queries in\nreal-time [58]. For example, when new functionalities are released\non smartphones, they often require purchasing the most recent\nversions of phones to use them, as was the case with the recent\nlaunch of Apple Intelligence, which runs only on the most recent\ngenerations of iPhones [7], as well as running most of its processing\nin the cloud, rather than on-device [34].\nOn a more macro level still, economy-wide rebound effects\noccur when an innovation provokes far-reaching changes in the\nproduction and use of other goods, producing flow-on effects in\nthe economy at large. For instance, improvements in global en-\nergy efficiency and fuel use have enabled the development of new\neconomies on a global scale, allowing the creation of new indus-\ntries [87]. These types of rebound effects can be particularly large\nfor so-called “general-purpose technologies” such as electricity, the\nsteam engine and the Internet, since these can have global spillover\neffects on industries and labor markets [111, 112]. Estimating the\nscope of economy-wide rebound effects has historically been dif-\nficult [117], especially for technologies [ 43]. One way in which\nAI is concretely impacting the economy at large is via PPAs, as\nmentioned in Section 2.2. In 2020, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and\nGoogle alone accounted for almost 30% of all PPAs purchased by\ncorporations worldwide [131], changing the scope and extent of the\nmechanism as a whole. Renewable energy PPAs mitigate the risk of\ninvestment in renewable energy infrastructure, thereby supporting\nits development [122]. Further, while a portion of the generated\nrenewable energy is transmitted to purchasers in practice, the re-\nmainder is added to the energy grid in that region, allowing other\nusers to benefit from its availability.

Efficiency Gains to Rebound Effects FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece\nfoundation models are general purpose technologies with corre-\nsponding potential for broad impacts to the economy and labor\nmarkets [35]. Analyzing the impact of these changes in the future\nwill be necessary to validate this claim (we discuss approaches to\ntracking AI’s indirect impacts in Section 3.4).\n3.3 Societal and Behavioral Rebound Effects\nAs users of technology and citizens of society, our behaviors are\nshaped and affected by the technologies we use. This has increas-\ningly become the case for AI as it becomes more intertwined in\ndaily activities such as shopping, travel, household chores, and\nthe workplace. In this section, we describe ways in which AI can\nimpact human behaviors and how those changes, can have broader\nenvironmental impacts in turn.\nInduction effects occur when the savings in resource consump-\ntion (e.g. energy or water) gained through improved efficiency are\nexceeded by the increased consumption and thereby production of\neither the materials or the final products. For instance, the advent of\nfast fashion and mass-produced furniture have reduced the quantity\nof natural resources, such as wood or cotton, needed to produce\na single piece of clothing or furniture. However, the amount of\nplastics, petrochemicals and waste that are engendered by the in-\ncreased accessibility of these items and therefore their increased\nconsumption are damaging to the environment [81]. In the case of\nAI, a prime example of this is targeted advertising, one of the most\nlucrative commercial applications of AI, with revenues reaching $36\nbillion in 2024 [116]. Advertising also constitutes the main source\nof revenue for many technology companies such as Google and\nMeta [85]; Amazon’s AI-powered product recommendation tool\ngenerates almost a third of its annual sales [73]. Although it is diffi-\ncult to obtain quantitative data on the impact of AI on e-commerce,\nthe details of which are largely considered sensitive trade secrets,\nthe corresponding machine learning approaches of recommenda-\ntion and ranking are active topics of research in the AI community,\npowered by an enormous quantity of user data being continuously\ngathered through interactions with digital platforms [ 19, 20, 31].\nThe rapid expansion of online advertising its direct and indirect\nenvironmental impacts have been emphasized in research papers\nand scientific reports over the last years [47, 91]. The contribution\nof AI to this expansion is worth considering when measuring the\nperformance of new algorithms and approaches [ 28], especially\ngiven the net-zero and emission reduction goals of many AI-driven\ncompanies whose revenue models depend on it [135].\nTime rebound effects occur when an innovation changes con-\nsumers’ use of their time, which then frees up (or removes) time\nfor other activities that they carry out. For example, if a vacuum\ncleaner reduces the time needed to clean the floors in a house, it\ncan free up time for leisure activities such as reading or sports. Mea-\nsuring the sustainability benefits of these time savings is far from\nstraightforward, because what we do with this newly-freed time\ncan have negative environmental impacts as well, e.g. if time other-\nwise spent doing chores is now spent shopping or traveling, this\ncan increase one’s overall carbon footprint [15]. AI is undeniably\nimpacting how time is spent at work and at home: many activities\nhave already been streamlined using AI over the last decade, such\nas AI-enabled navigation that avoids traffic congestion, automated\nlicense plate recognition and tolling on highways, and robotic vacu-\nums. Initial work on the environmental consequences of these shifts\nhas proposed that AI-enabled automation in household tasks and\nin the workplace actually leads to greater resource consumption\nand higher negative environmental impacts overall [36]. This con-\ntradicts research carried out on AI-assisted navigation specifically,\nwhich has been shown to reduce emissions by an average of 3.4%,\nbased on data gathered by Google on users of Google Maps [ 8].\nThis discrepancy highlights the difficulty of making far-reaching\nclaims regarding the sustainability impacts of a given innovation\nwithout considering the spillover effects and behavioral changes\nthat it may engender more broadly.\nIndirect policy effects. In addition to societal and behavioral\nforces, there are also indirect geopolitical and policy effects. Inter-\nnational policy interventions, particularly those aiming to bolster\nnational self-sufficiency from global supply chains, can provoke\nunintended increases in environmental burdens through mineral de-\nmand amplification, industrial deregulation, and competitive over-\nproduction. The dynamics of Koomey’s Law, by which the energy\nefficiency of computing has historically doubled approximately ev-\nery 1.57 years, can also be affected by geopolitical disputes and trade\nwars. If chip sales are restricted, for example, nations have to make\ndo with less powerful and less energy-efficient semiconductors.\nAs national strategies to monopolize or re-shore semiconductor\ncapacity develop, this can further accelerate national rivalries and\nresult in the replication of systems and further resource-intensive\nscaling of model training infrastructure. The United States CHIPS\nand Science Act (2022) is one example. This legislation aims to\nre-shore semiconductor fabrication. While its primary goal is to\nreduce dependency on Chinese manufacturing, it has the potential\nto intensify domestic resource demands. Semiconductor fabrication\nfacilities (known as fabs) impose massive environmental burdens,\nconsuming large quantities of energy, water and specialized chemi-\ncals while generating substantial carbon emissions (Villard, 2015).\nThe domestic expansion of fabs in the United States shifts rather\nthan reduces these environmental impacts, potentially introducing\nnew ecological pressures in regions with water scarcity issues like\nArizona, where several new facilities were planned. Meanwhile\nthe ongoing resource pressures continue in China and Taiwan.\nMoreover, the race to decouple US semiconductor supply chains\nfrom geopolitical adversaries has led to intensified extraction of\nrare-earth elements, lithium, cobalt, and high-purity quartz. This\ngeopolitical reorganization of material flows extends the environ-\nmental footprint of AI beyond traditional carbon accounting. China\nrestricting the export of several rare earth elements has meant that\nmines in Ukraine and Australia are already under expanded pres-\nsure to meet US demand. The increased competition for critical\nminerals has both social and ecological impacts, and risks even\ngreater environmental harms in conflict-affected regions.\nThese indirect policy effects risks are further compounded when\nenvironmental deregulation coincides with large-scale investment\nin AI-related infrastructure.

While\ntracking direct impacts can largely be achieved by monitoring a\nfinite set of relatively well-defined metrics, such as liters of water\nconsumed or tons of CO2 emitted, rebound effects by definition en-\ncompass social, economic, and behavioral impacts across different\nareas of society [114]. Realizing effective progress in characterizing\nAI’s rebound effects necessitates moving beyond the binary narra-\ntive towards more holistic assessment that incorporates a variety of\ncomplementary approaches. We discuss some of these approaches\nbelow.\nQualitative and quantitative research. Starting with the material\nrebound effects of digital technologies such as AI, it can be tempting\nto make comparisons such as the research described in Section 3.1,\nwhich carry out LCA comparisons between e.g. a book and an e-\nreader. However, we are currently lacking sufficient methodology\nand data that would allow for meaningful comparison of the en-\nvironmental impacts of humans versus the same tasks performed\nby humans alone or assisted by AI. Initial work on this subject\nhas concluded that “AI systems emit between 130 and 1500 times\nless CO2e per page of text generated compared to human writers,\nwhile AI illustration systems emit between 310 and 2900 times\nless CO2e per image than their human counterparts, ” however, the\nauthors themselves note that their analyses “do not account for\nsocial impacts such as professional displacement, legality, and re-\nbound effects” [128]. More qualitative and multi-faceted analyses\nare needed, such as those that take into account aspects like the\nlength of time that content will actually be useful to readers and\nthe way in which the data was collected, can help shed light on\nthe issue, as well as more empirical research to study how human\nartists and writers use AI technologies and how that impacts the\nenvironment.\nTransparency. A key challenge to tracking AI’s economic re-\nbound effects stems from the severe scarcity of information regard-\ning the nature and extent of AI’s actual permeation throughout the\neconomy. The rapid integration of AI into many existing products\nand services, combined with vague and often broad definitions of\nAI, has made it difficult to disentangle AI-influenced growth from\ngrowth that might have occurred regardless. This challenge is in-\ntensified by the perception that details on corporate AI model use\nrepresent valuable intellectual property and trade secrets. Gath-\nering more information about specific AI deployment scenarios,\ni.e. which AI models are actually being deployed, in which sectors,\nwhat are they being used for in practice, and what are the impacts\nof those uses, will become increasingly important as AI becomes\nestablished as a mainstream technology. Connecting data on AI\nmodel resource consumption to corresponding positive or negative\nimpacts arising from those models is key to understanding trade-\noffs and informing decision-making. In the case of induction effects\nin particular, establishing baselines across industries, for instance\ndocumenting the environmental impacts of technologies currently\nin use, and measuring changes to those baselines as AI is integrated\nwould enable tracking longitudinal trends. Requiring companies\nusing AI in applications such as targeted advertising to indicate this\nusage, as well as what data was used to choose an ad for a specific\nproduct, can help users better understand why they are receiving\nads and contribute towards more mindful consumption [26, 79].\nRegulation. While focusing on efficiency alone has largely been\nsufficient in the past to curb the environmental impacts of rising\ncompute [75], given the astronomical rise in computational (and\ncorresponding energy and natural) resources needed to power AI\nservices resulting from generative AI, complementary efforts are\nneeded to address these impacts [108]. Historically, economic poli-\ncies that increase the cost of these resources have been shown to\nhelp control certain rebound effects [39]. Initiatives such as energy\nefficiency certifications (e.g. the U.S EPA’s Energy Star certifica-\ntion, Energy Labels in the EU) can also reduce resource use by\nincentivizing the sales and production of more efficient tools and\nsystems, successful for increasing energy efficiency for household\nappliances [27].

Greece\nso far to operationalize such a proposal. Regulations could also\nserve an important role in mandating reporting of the necessary\ndata described above, e.g. requiring disclosure of the usage of AI\nfor environmentally harmful applications such as oil and gas ex-\nploration, which although highly relevant, is not typically reflected\nin corporate Environment and Sustainability Governance (ESG)\ndocuments.\nEfficient devices and distributed compute. Resource-efficient com-\nputing devices that require less natural resources (energy, water,\nraw materials) to build and use can be seen as an obvious gain in\nterms of environmental impacts, and different hardware platforms\nare being developed towards this end as an alternative to GPUs and\nCPUs, which represent the current status quo of AI computing hard-\nware [61, 62]. It is worth noting that there is typically a trade-off\nbetween resource efficiency and generality in terms of the compu-\ntational capabilities of the hardware: substantial efficiency gains\ntypically require the hardware to be correspondingly specialized to\ncertain types of computation, such as a specific family of AI models,\nwhich can accelerate indirect effects via lock-in, increasing depen-\ndence on a narrow set of vendors or products. New approaches\nto distributed and decentralized computation, in which AI model\nworkloads can be distributed across machines over wide distances\nrather than running within a single computing cluster or datacen-\nter, can also help distribute environmental burden geographically\nin terms of resource demand and local impacts. Examples include\nfully decentralized training [59] or redirecting training processes\ndepending on which cloud region has the lowest carbon intensity\nat a given time of day [30]. Above and beyond sustainability con-\nsiderations, adopting more flexible AI hardware and algorithms can\nhelp lower the barrier to entry into the field of AI and push back\nagainst industry monopolization of computational resources, and\ncorresponding power imbalance that this creates [1, 2].\n4 Discussion\nIn the context of climate change, artificial intelligence has emerged\nas a highly polarizing technology. On the one hand, it is champi-\noned as a driver of efficiency that could potentially invent new\nsolutions to the climate crisis or reinvent old ones [5, 21, 99]; on\nthe other hand, it is criticized for its steeply increasing resource\ndemands and carbon footprint [68, 120, 134]. This debate overlooks\na significant reality: we still do not have a comprehensive picture\nof AI’s current environmental impacts on everything from eco-\nnomic systems to individual behaviors. Consequently, the AI field\nrisks simplifying the nuances that must be understood if AI is to\nbe responsibly integrated into environmental policy and practice\nwithout exacerbating harms. A more accurate assessment of AI’s\nenvironmental outcomes would include a wider range of factors\nspanning data center operations, supply chains, hardware lifecy-\ncles, social behaviors, business incentives, policy commitments, and\ninstitutional practices.\nAs mentioned in Section 3, one under-explored dimension in\nthese debates involves the indirect or rebound effects that AI can\ngenerate. While much attention has been given to AI improving\nproductivity and resource efficiency, these gains can result in higher\noverall consumption due to effects such as Jevons Paradox. This\nparadox can manifest in several ways: for instance, an AI-driven\nlogistics system might reduce delivery times and fuel usage per\nvehicle, yet simultaneously encourage more frequent online orders,\nthus elevating total miles driven; AI-driven targeted advertising\ncan help us more easily find the products that we need based on\nour clicks and searches, but also push us to make more superflu-\nous purchases. Such systemic shifts in behavior challenge linear\nexpectations that efficiency improvements alone will drive down\nemissions. Instead, they underscore the need for a detailed, interdis-\nciplinary approach that links AI deployment to broader assessments\nof environmental, social, and economic feedback loops.\nApplying Jevons’ Paradox to technologies like AI has notable\nconceptual and empirical limitations due to the complexity inher-\nent in technological development and diffusion [101, 113]. While\nJevons’ Paradox anticipates increases in resource consumption fol-\nlowing efficiency improvements, its explanatory power diminishes\nwithin the broader systemic contexts of widespread AI diffusion.\nSorrell [2008] critiques Jevons’ paradox for oversimplifying complex\ncausal relationships among efficiency gains, economic expansion,\nand individual behavioral responses. This is particularly relevant\ngiven AI systems have many interdependencies across diverse eco-\nnomic sectors. Addressing these multifaceted rebound effects re-\nquires shifting from simplistic causal assumptions toward more\nintegrated sociotechnical analyses that can include a range of ap-\nproaches, from detailed empirical studies of technology adoption,\nuser behavior, policy factors, and evolving market dynamics. That\nwould also suggest that truly effective policy responses for AI sus-\ntainability would need to combine technological efficiency with\ninstitutional reforms and incentive structures specifically designed\nto decouple model development from unsustainable resource con-\nsumption. This approach would not only recognize the conditional\nvalidity of Jevons’ Paradox but actively embed sustainability within\nAI development.\nAlthough the research community has taken initial steps toward\nquantifying AI’s carbon footprint and water usage, these efforts\noften focus on direct resource consumption during model training\nand inference. While such measurements are essential, they are\nonly a partial view. Global supply chains—encompassing the extrac-\ntion of raw materials, the manufacturing of semiconductor chips,\nand the disposal of electronic waste—also contribute substantially\nto AI’s environmental cost, yet these distributed impacts remain\nnotoriously difficult to track [24, 83]. Companies and researchers\ncommonly disclose only a narrow range of environmental met-\nrics. This lack of standardized reporting impedes a full lifecycle\nassessment and perpetuates an environment in which the indirect\nburdens of AI remain opaque [72].\nAnother critical factor is the current market-driven context\nin which AI operates. At present, the most prominent AI break-\nthroughs, particularly large language models, function within an\neconomic system that rewards rapid growth and ever-increasing\ncomputational power [4, 125].
