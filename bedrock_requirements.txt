# Bedrock-only requirements — fully torch-free alternative to
# local_requirements.txt for machines that run the pipeline entirely
# through AWS Bedrock (LLM + embeddings).
#
# Usage:
#   uv pip install -r bedrock_requirements.txt
#
# This setup does NOT install torch, torchvision, or any GPU libraries.
# Both the LLM (chat) and embedding calls go to Bedrock over the network.
#
# To use this path, set `embedding_model = "bedrock"` in your config
# (see vendor/KohakuRAG/configs/bedrock_*.py).  The default bedrock
# configs already do this.
#
# If you need local Jina V4 embeddings instead (e.g. for index-building),
# install local_requirements.txt on a machine with a GPU.
