# Bedrock-only requirements — lightweight alternative to local_requirements.txt
# for machines that only run Bedrock (cloud LLM) benchmarks.
#
# Usage:
#   uv pip install -r bedrock_requirements.txt
#
# NOTE: The transformers pin is critical. The Jina V4 embedding model code
# imports SlidingWindowCache from transformers.cache_utils, which was removed
# in transformers 5.x.  Without the <5 cap you will see:
#   ImportError: cannot import name 'SlidingWindowCache' from
#   'transformers.cache_utils'
