# Bedrock-only requirements — lightweight alternative to local_requirements.txt
# for machines that only run Bedrock (cloud LLM) benchmarks.
#
# Usage:
#   uv pip install -r bedrock_requirements.txt
#
# This installs CPU-only torch (no CUDA), which is ~200 MB instead of ~2.5 GB.
# The Jina V4 embedding model still runs locally but works fine on CPU.
#
# NOTE: The transformers<5 pin is critical — the Jina V4 model code imports
# SlidingWindowCache from transformers.cache_utils, which was removed in 5.x.
