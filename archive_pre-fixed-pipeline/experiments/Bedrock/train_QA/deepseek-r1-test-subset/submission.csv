"q001","What was the average increase in U.S. data center electricity consumption between 2010 and 2014?","The context snippet from ref_id=wu2021b explicitly states that the total energy consumption of US data centers increased by about 4% from 2010-2014. This directly answers the question about the average increase in electricity consumption during that period.","4","percent","[""wu2021b""]","is_blank","is_blank","The context snippet from ref_id=wu2021b explicitly states that the total energy consumption of US data centers increased by about 4% from 2010-2014.

"q005","Since NVIDIA doesn't release the embodied carbon emissions of its hardware, what are the estimated embodied carbon emissions in kg per GPU?","The context from ref_id=morrison2025 states that NVIDIA does not release embodied carbon emissions data, but they assume 3700 kg CO2eq per 8x server node (463 kg per GPU) based on previous work by Luccioni et al. (2023). Additionally, they provide an amortized embodied emission rate of 0.013 kg CO2eq per GPU hour over a 4-year lifespan.","463 kg/GPU","kg/GPU","[""morrison2025""]","is_blank","is_blank","The context from ref_id=morrison2025 states that NVIDIA does not release embodied carbon emissions data, but they assume 3700 kg CO2eq per 8x server node (463 kg per GPU) based on previous work by Luccioni et al.

"q006","By what factor was the estimated amortized training cost of GPT-4 greater than the total training budget for FLM-101B?","The context states that the estimated amortized training cost of GPT-4 is $40 million (from ref_id=cottier2024) and the total training budget for FLM-101B is $100,000 (from ref_id=li2025a). The factor is calculated by dividing $40,000,000 by $100,000, resulting in 400.","400","ratio","[""cottier2024"", ""li2025a""]","is_blank","is_blank","The context states that the estimated amortized training cost of GPT-4 is $40 million (from ref_id=cottier2024) and the total training budget for FLM-101B is $100,000 (from ref_id=li2025a).
