# GB10-specific requirements — extends the base local requirements with
# CUDA 13.0 PyTorch wheels (the GB10 ships with CUDA 13.0 toolkit).
#
# Usage:
#   uv pip install -r local_requirements_gb10.txt
#
# This MUST be used instead of local_requirements.txt on the GB10,
# otherwise torch installs as CPU-only and the GPU sits idle.
